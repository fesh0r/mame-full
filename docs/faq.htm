		<h2>MESS FAQ?</h2>
		<p>This FAQ was written to support MESS. If you have any changes, suggestions or 
			additions please contact the MESS team. Changes will be made as time is 
			available. If you have a question that is not answered in this FAQ, try the 
			searching the MESS message boards. There is a wealth of information there 
			already.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g01">What is MESS?</h2>
		<p>MESS is an acronym that stands for Multiple Emulator Super System. MESS will 
			more or less faithfully reproduce computer and console systems on a PC. MESS 
			can currently emulate over 250 systems from the last 5 decades.
		</p>
		<p>MESS emulates the hardware of the systems and sometimes utilizes ROM images to 
			load programs and games. Therefore, these systems are NOT simulations, but the 
			actual emulations of the hardware.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g02">What is the purpose of MESS?</h2>
		<p>The primary purpose of MESS is to preserve decades of computer and console 
			history. As technology continues to rush forward, MESS prevents these important 
			"vintage" systems from being lost and forgotten. MESS is based on MAME. 
			Additional information about MESS or MAME can be found at <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				www.mess.org</a> or <a href="http://www.mame.net/">www.mame.net</a>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g03">What is an emulator and a simulator?</h2>
		<p>An <i>emulator</i> attempts to recreate the original functions of the hardware. 
			Software run on a emulator should perform exactly as if it were being run on 
			the original hardware.
		</p>
		<p>A <i>simulator</i> attempts to recreate the original functions of the software, 
			essentially imitating the game or software. The end results may look very 
			similar between emulation and simulation but they are very different in how 
			they are implemented.
		</p>
		<p>MESS and MAME are both emulators. They try to emulate the arcade, computer, and 
			console system. This may include bugs or flaws that were on the original 
			system.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g04">What makes MESS different from other emulators?</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				MESS emulates many types of systems (console, computer, handheld, calculator 
				etc...), not just one like some other emulators.
				<li>
				MESS is free.
				<li>
				MESS is open source so anyone who knows C programming language can help improve 
				the project.
				<li>
					The architecture of MESS makes it easy to add lesser known systems.
				</li>
			</ul>
			The primary objective of MESS is to accurately emulate multiple systems. Most 
			stand alone emulators/simulators often focus on letting you play games on your 
			PC. They often include speed hacks or fudge things to make them <i>look</i> right. 
			The philosophy of MESS is to behave <u>exactly</u> like the original hardware, 
			even if it is slower, so that <u>all</u> software for the original machine will 
			work as it would on the original hardware. This tends to make MESS a bit slower 
			than other emulators, but this is not always true.
			<h2 id="g05">Is MESS really free?</h2>
		<p>Yes, MESS is really free. The source code is freely available, too. It is 
			illegal to sell MESS or its source.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g06">Isn't MESS the same as MAME?</h2>
		<p>No. MESS is based on MAME, and uses the same underlying engine, but its goals 
			are different. To put it simply, MAME is for arcade machines, and MESS is for 
			home computers and video game consoles.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g07">Why don't MESS and MAME merge?</h2>
		<p>Although the people involved in developing new versions of both programs are 
			enthusiasts working out of love for the systems involved, the systems are 
			essentially different. Arcade games, which <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
			specializes in, are usually unique, in that the hardware for any particular 
			game was a one-time solution arrived at in order to get the game to market. 
			Some game companies, such as SNK, Nintendo and others, did develop systems that 
			could be changed over to play other games relatively easily, but this wasn't 
			the rule in the arcades. To emulate an arcade game, the programmer develops a 
			driver file which mimics hardware surrounding the arcade game's CPU or CPUs. 
			Both MAME and MESS contain the same cores to emulate the same CPUs. The focus 
			of MESS is accurate emulation of the hardware of computer and gaming consoles, 
			hardware which doesn't change depending on which game or program is being run. 
			Fundamentally, MAME and MESS are being created by and are targeted for slightly 
			different segments of the emulation community: gamers and vintage computer 
			enthusiasts. Those two communities do often times overlap, and a merger of the 
			two programs is theoretically possible at some point in the future.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g08">Why doesn't MESS split into two versions, one for consoles and one for 
			computers?</h2>
		<p>Why isn't there a program called MASS to mimic mainframes? So far it hasn't 
			seemed necessary to split MESS;into two programs. The core program inherited on 
			a regular basis from new updates of MAME; can accommodate a large number of 
			systems. If you think of each arcade game in&nbsp;MAME as a separate computer 
			or console, the latest version has over 3,000 different machines available, 
			compared to MESS' hundreds of systems listed under its All Systems menu. The 
			border dividing gaming consoles from computers tends to blur the further back 
			you go in time. Is Nippon Electric Company's PC Engine a game system or a 
			computer? Coleco originally marketed its Adam computer as an add-on to the 
			Colecovision gaming system. Nintendo also had big plans to turn its NES and 
			later SNES into full-fledged computers delivering information and services to 
			users over an early version of the internet. The APF Imagination Machine was 
			also built around a game console core. Atari's computers grew from its original 
			gaming consoles, and were probably used more for gaming in their day than any 
			serious computing projects. The simple answer is there is still a lot of room 
			for&nbsp;MESS to include new gaming consoles and computers. The complicated 
			answer is that it is hard to tell the difference.
		</p>
		<h2 id="g09">How come my emails to the MESS developers do not receive replies?</h2>
		<p>The MESS developers receive a large volume of email, and also suffer from "Real 
			life syndrome", and thus might not be able to reply.&nbsp; Your best bet is to 
			ask a question on the MESS message board at <A href="http://www.mess.org/">http://www.mess.org/</A></p>
		<h2 id="s01">What do I need to run MESS?</h2>
		<p>In general a PC with a decent processor should run most of the systems at a 
			decent speed. There are an enormous variety of systems emulated and each system 
			has its own requirements. The best thing to do is try the system you are 
			interested in. But remember accuracy is the primary goal not speed.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s02">What is a BIOS?/What's a ROM?/What is a disk image?</h2>
		<p>First, it is important to note that in the emulation world, the term ROM is used 
			to refer to two different things:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			The ROM chips within a computer system, that usually contain some form of BASIC 
			or the like
			<li>
				The ROM chips within a game cartridge for a console system
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For the sake of clarity, the official MESS terminology for #1 is "BIOS", after 
			what they are typically called in Intel PC systems, and the term "ROM" is 
			avoided.&nbsp; The term "cartridge image" is used to refer to #2, where "image" 
			is a generic term that applies to downloaded images of removable media, whether 
			they be a cartridge, a floppy drive, or a hard disk.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s03">Where do I get BIOSes/ROMs?/How do I use my old software with MESS?</h2>
		<p>In most cases, old software is physically incompatible with modern computers. No 
			matter how hard you push, an Atari cartridge just plain won't fit in your 
			computer's floppy drive. Folding up old 5 1/4" diskettes so they fit in a 3 
			1/2" drive will only break your disks. Obviously there is a problem here - how 
			do I get that software into my PC so an emulator can use it?
		</p>
		<p>It is possible to build special cartridge reading devices for console systems 
			and hook up old computers to new ones to transfer floppy disks. These media get 
			transferred into files on the new computer.
		</p>
		<p>Now, originally emulation was just for hobbyists who had all this special 
			equipment, but some of them put these BIOSes and images up on the Internet for 
			people to download, on the honor system that people would only download the 
			BIOSes and images that they owned the original software for. Unfortunately, a 
			lot of people came along who just wanted to download free games and did not 
			care about preservation, and gave the emulation community a bad name among 
			software companies. There are many BIOSes/images sites on the Internet, using a 
			search engine should turn up the ones you want. But remember: downloading 
			pirated BIOSes/images that you do not own is illegal. Some people say that the 
			copyrights have expired or that you can download it if you delete it after 24 
			hours, but they are wrong. It is up to you whether you want to ignore the law, 
			as most of the games are not and will not ever be sold again.
		</p>
		<p>Most systems require BIOSes. MESS is very picky about its BIOSes -- they must be 
			exactly the ones it is expecting, otherwise it may not work.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s04">Okay, I got some BIOSes and images, now where do I put them?
			<P></P>
		</h2>
		<p>BIOSes should go, still zipped, in the BIOS subfolder of wherever you put MESS. 
			Game images should go into the SOFTWARE\[system name] folder. They can still be 
			zipped, but only one image per zip file.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s05">How do I start the MESS application?</h2>
		<p>For DOS, type "mess [system] [device] [game] [options]", where [system] is the 
			system driver name, [device] is the type of ROM, [game] is the filename of the 
			ROM, and options are command line options. Valid [device] names (eg -cart and 
			-flop) can be found by using "mess -listdevices" and valid options are listed 
			in the mess.txt and msdos.txt files.
		</p>
		<p>For example:
			<br>
			mess nes -cart zelda.nes -nosound (This will run the Zelda game on the Nintendo 
			system without sound. See mess.txt for more examples.
		</p>
		<p>For UNIX/Linux, do the same thing except the name of the program is xmess.
		</p>
		<p>For Macintosh or Windows OS, run the MacMESS or messgui.exe application and 
			click on the system or software you want to run.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s06">I did everything just like you said, but it still does not work!
			<P></P>

		<p>There is a message board you can go to for help at <a href="http://www.mess.org/">http://www.mess.org</a>. 
			But first, make sure you read this FAQ and the rest of the documentation. The 
			answers can often be found there. Also check out the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> FAQ at <a href="http://www.mame.net/">http://www.mame.net</a> --it 
			is a very good resource for things common to <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
			and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, such as sound and graphics setup. 
			Also search through the message board to see if somebody already had the same 
			problem. And at least put some effort into fixing it yourself. People on 
			message boards can get very annoyed with people who ask questions that have 
			already been answered elsewhere, especially in readme.txt and mess.txt.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s07">It works, but it is way too slow!</h2>
		<p>Because of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' goal of compatibility over 
			speed, this is often the case. You might think that your computer should be 
			able to emulate such old machines at full speed, but keep in mind that <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
				MESS</a> is not performing any shortcuts in the emulation. Many other 
			emulators perform shortcuts that sacrifice compatibility in favor of 
			performance, which is a valid tradeoff given a different set of design goals. 
			With <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, your CPU is doing the jobs of the 
			CPU(s), graphics chip(s), sound chip(s), as well as any other special hardware 
			present in the original machine, so it can be bogged down fairly easily, 
			especially by the relatively unoptimized <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
			core. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is written almost entirely in C, 
			not assembly, for compatibility reasons. Additionally, there is a level of 
			overhead required to get the level of modularity that it takes to have the 
			myriad components in the emulation be usable across a broad set of drivers. 
			There are some tweaks you can do to speed up the performance a bit (see the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
				MAME</a> FAQ), but if you need a big boost, there is not much you can do 
			except buy a faster computer, wait for an update (not likely), or use another 
			emulator.
		</p>
		<h2 id="s08">For some reason, ESC does not quit MESS nor does TAB bring up the 
			menu!</h2>
		<p>In MESS for Win32, there are two UIs use at runtime. There is the "Classic UI" 
			which is derived from MAME's UI, and there is the "New UI" which uses a 
			standard Windows menubar to operate the emulation.&nbsp; By default, the New UI 
			is enabled.&nbsp; However, some people prefer to use the older UI.&nbsp; This 
			can be done in one of two ways.</p>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			When running the MESS GUI (messgui.exe), choose "Options --&gt; Default System 
			Options --&gt; Miscellaneous Tab" and uncheck the&nbsp;"Use New UI" checkbox.
			<LI>
				If it exists, edit mess.ini and change the "newui" setting to "0".&nbsp; For 
				more details on mess.ini, consult <a href="windows/win32cmd.htm">Using MESS at the 
					Command Line</a>
			</LI>
		</OL>
		<h2 id="h01">How do I set up the screenshots/snapshots folder for MESS?</h2>
		<p>The snapshot (aka screenshot) folder is the place to store images to be 
			displayed in the GUI. It can display in-game/software images and system images, 
			or anything else as long as it is named correctly.
		</p>
		<p>The snapshot folder can be configured in the Directories… window under the 
			Options menu in the GUI. The default screen folder is snap. Store system images 
			with the system name. Store software/game snapshots in a folder under the 
			system they belong to.
		</p>
		<p>For example:
			<br>
			mess/snap/a2600.png &lt;&lt;&lt; This is a picture of an Atari system. The name 
			needs to match the driver.<br>
			mess/snap/a2600/junglehunt.png &lt;&lt;&lt; This is an in-game screenshot of 
			the game Jungle Hunt. The name needs to match game name.
		</p>
		<h2 id="h02">How do get screenshots?</h2>
		<p>You can take your own screen shots by selecting the ‘Save Screenshot’ option in 
			the file menu while in emulation. This will save an image in the png format 
			with the name of the driver (if one does not exist already). If an image 
			already exists an a sequential number will be added to the name (for example 
			coco.png, coco0000.png, coco0001.png etc...).
		</p>
		<p>You can also find many images on various emulation or download images from the 
			internet at various sites. Try your favorite search engine.
		</p>
		<h2 id="h03">How do I compile/build MESS?</h2>
		<p>For Windows, see the <A href="windows/compile.htm">How to compile MESS (Win32)</A>
			document.&nbsp; Compiling MESS for Windows requires the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">
				MinGW</a> toolkit, a variant of <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="h04">How do I compile/build MESS with Visual C?</h2>
		<p>On the MESS download site, there are Visual C project files but they are 
			extremely outdated. In theory, one could grab the <a href="http://www.vcmame.net/">VCMame</a>
			project files and port them over to build MESS, but to my knowledge noone has 
			done this yet.</p>
		<P>There is also an alternative makefile (makefile.vc) that uses the Visual C 
			command line compilers but the makefile itself requires <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">
				GNU make</a> rather than nmake.&nbsp; Using the Microsoft compilers allows 
			one to use the Visual C debugger to debug MESS, but one does not get the full 
			benefits of the IDE.</P>
		<h2 id="h05">How do I contribute to the MESS project?</h2>
		<p>If you have programming skills, you can download the source and fix bugs, 
			improve emulation on existing systems or add a new one! If you fix anything, be 
			sure to submit the fixes so they can be included in the source. Be advised that 
			corrections or additions may not be accepted if they are hackish in nature - 
			MESS strives for accuracy both in emulation and in the source code. Another 
			major concern is the verifiability of the changes.&nbsp; One major obstacle in 
			MESS that often the MESS maintainer may understand the system much less than 
			you do, and it can be very difficult for the MESS maintainer to confirm any 
			changes, so identifying programs that start working after any changes can be 
			helpful.</p>
		<p>If you do not have programming skills, you can help by documenting emulatad 
			systems and software, reporting bugs, submitting artwork and so on - anything 
			to asssit those with programming skills and improve the project.
		</p>
		<h2 id="t01">I have found a bug; what can I do to help the MESS developers fix it?</h2>
		<p>If you are comfortable programming C, you can download the MESS source code and 
			attempt to fix it yourself.&nbsp;If you have questions about the MESS source, 
			you can ask them on the MESS message board.
		</p>
		<P>If you are not comfortable programming C, the best thing for you to do is to 
			create a reproducible case and report it at <a href="http://bugzilla.mess.org">MESS 
				Bugzilla</a>.&nbsp; When reporting a bug, be sure to keep in mind that MESS 
			is a multiple emulation system, and the reader of your bug report might not be 
			intimitely familiar with the system that you are using.&nbsp;In other words, if 
			you find a bug in the WowieZowie driver, do not expect the reader of the bug 
			report to know the command for loading a file on WowieZowieOS.&nbsp;If a bug 
			report contains a concrete reproducible case that is understandable even to 
			someone not familiar with that system, it is much more likely to be 
			fixed.&nbsp; Alternatively, if a bug was not present in an earlier MESS 
			version, it helps greatly to identify which MESS version introduced the bug.</P>
		<h2 ID="t02">My English is not good. I do not understand!</h2>
		<p>
			If you ask for help on the message board, post it in both English and your 
			native language. Many people there speak more than one language and may be able 
			to help you in your native language. Also, visit <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com">
				http://babelfish.altavista.com</a>. They have a translation program that 
			can translate between English and most European languages as well as a number 
			of other languages. Also look at the MAME FAQ at <a href="http://www.mame.net">http://www.mame.net</a>. 
			It is in many different languages, including Greek, Serbian, Romanian, 
			Norwegian, Danish, Hebrew, Czech, Dutch, French, Italian, Korean, Japanese, 
			Chinese, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Finnish.
