		<h2>MESS FAQ?</h2>
					<p>
						This FAQ was written to support MESS. If you have any changes, suggestions or 
						additions please contact the MESS team. Changes will be made as time is 
						available. If you have a question that is not answered in this FAQ, try the 
						searching the MESS message boards. There is a wealth of information there 
						already.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="g01">What is MESS?</h2>
					<p>
						MESS is an acronym that stands for Multiple Emulator Super System. MESS will 
						more or less faithfully reproduce computer and console systems on a PC. MESS 
						can currently emulate over 250 systems from the last 5 decades.
					</p>
					<p>
						MESS emulates the hardware of the systems and sometimes utilizes ROM images to 
						load programs and games. Therefore, these systems are NOT simulations, but the 
						actual emulations of the hardware.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="g02">What is the purpose of MESS?</h2>
					<p>
						The primary purpose of MESS is to preserve decades of computer and console 
						history. As technology continues to rush forward, MESS prevents these important 
						"vintage" systems from being lost and forgotten. MESS is based on MAME. 
						Additional information about MESS or MAME can be found at <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
							www.mess.org</a> or <a href="http://www.mame.net/">www.mame.net</a>.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="g03">What is an emulator and a simulator?</h2>
					<p>
						An <i>emulator</i> attempts to recreate the original functions of the hardware.
						Software run on a emulator should perform exactly as if it were being run on the 
						original hardware.
					</p>
					<p>
						A <i>simulator</i> attempts to recreate the original functions of the software, 
						essentially imitating the game or software. The end results may look very similar 
						between emulation and simulation but they are very different in how they are 
						implemented.
					</p>
					<p>
						MESS and MAME are both emulators. They try to emulate the arcade, computer, and 
						console system. This may include bugs or flaws that were on the original 
						system.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="g04">What makes MESS different from other emulators?</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
							MESS emulates many types of systems (console, computer, handheld, calculator 
							etc...), not just one like some other emulators.
							<li>
							MESS is free.
							<li>
							MESS is open source so anyone who knows C programming language can help improve 
							the project.
							<li>
							The architecture of MESS makes it easy to add lesser known systems.
						</ul>
						The primary objective of MESS is to accurately emulate multiple systems. Most 
						stand alone emulators/simulators often focus on letting you play games on your 
						PC. They often include speed hacks or fudge things to make them <i>look</i> right. 
						The philosophy of MESS is to behave <u>exactly</u> like the original hardware, 
						even if it is slower, so that <u>all</u> software for the original machine will 
						work as it would on the original hardware. This tends to make MESS a bit slower 
						than other emulators, but this is not always true.
					<h2 ID="g05">Is MESS really free?</h2>
					<p>
						Yes, MESS is really free. The source code is freely available, too. It is 
						illegal to sell MESS or its source.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="g06">Isn't MESS the same as MAME?</h2>
					<p>
						No. MESS is based on MAME, and uses the same underlying engine, but its goals are different. 
						To put it simply, MAME is for arcade machines, and MESS is for home computers and 
						video game consoles.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="g07">Why don't MESS and MAME merge?</h2>
					<p>
						Although the people involved in developing new versions of both programs are 
						enthusiasts working out of love for the systems involved, the systems are 
						essentially different. Arcade games, which <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
						specializes in, are usually unique, in that the hardware for any particular 
						game was a one-time solution arrived at in order to get the game to market. 
						Some game companies, such as SNK, Nintendo and others, did develop systems that 
						could be changed over to play other games relatively easily, but this wasn't 
						the rule in the arcades. To emulate an arcade game, the programmer develops a 
						driver file which mimics hardware surrounding the arcade game's CPU or CPUs. 
						Both MAME and MESS contain the same cores to emulate the same CPUs. The focus 
						of MESS is accurate emulation of the hardware of computer and gaming consoles, 
						hardware which doesn't change depending on which game or program is being run. 
						Fundamentally, MAME and MESS are being created by and are targeted for slightly 
						different segments of the emulation community: gamers and vintage computer 
						enthusiasts. Those two communities do often times overlap, and a merger of the 
						two programs is theoretically possible at some point in the future.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="g08">Why doesn't MESS split into two versions, one for consoles and one for computers?</h2>
					<p>
						Why isn't there a program called MASS to mimic mainframes? So far it hasn't 
						seemed necessary to split <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>&nbsp;into two 
						programs. The core program inherited on a regular basis from new updates of <A href="http://www.mame.net/">
							MAME</A>&nbsp;can accommodate a large number of systems. If you think of 
						each arcade game in&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> as a separate 
						computer or console, the latest version has over 3,000 different machines 
						available, compared to <A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>' hundreds of 
						systems listed under its All Systems menu. The border dividing gaming consoles 
						from computers tends to blur the further back you go in time. Is Nippon 
						Electric Company's PC Engine a game system or a computer? Coleco originally 
						marketed its Adam computer as an add-on to the Colecovision gaming system. 
						Nintendo also had big plans to turn its NES and later SNES into full-fledged 
						computers delivering information and services to users over an early version of 
						the internet. The APF Imagination Machine was also built around a game console 
						core. Atari's computers grew from its original gaming consoles, and were probably
						 used more for gaming in their day than any serious computing projects.  The simple
						 answer is there is still a lot of room for&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</A>
						to include new gaming consoles and computers. The complicated answer is that 
						it is hard to tell the difference.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="s01">What do I need to run MESS?</h2>
					<p>
						In general a PC with a decent processor should run most of the systems at a 
						decent speed. There are an enormous variety of systems emulated and each system 
						has its own requirements. The best thing to do is try the system you are 
						interested in. But remember accuracy is the primary goal not speed.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="s02">What is a BIOS?/What's a ROM?/What is a disk image?</h2>
					<p>
						First, it is important to note that in the emulation world, the term ROM is 
						used to refer to two different things:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						The ROM chips within a computer system, that usually contain some form of BASIC 
						or the like
						<li>
							The ROM chips within a game cartridge for a console system</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						For the sake of clarity, the official MESS terminology for #1 is "BIOS", after 
						what they are typically called in Intel PC systems, and the term "ROM" is 
						avoided.&nbsp; The term "cartridge image" is used to refer to #2, where "image" 
						is a generic term that applies to downloaded images of removable media, whether 
						they be a cartridge, a floppy drive, or a hard disk.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="s03">Where do I get BIOSes/ROMs?/How do I use my old software with MESS?</h2>
					<p>
						In most cases, old software is physically incompatible with modern computers. 
						No matter how hard you push, an Atari cartridge just plain won't fit in your 
						computer's floppy drive. Folding up old 5 1/4" diskettes so they fit in a 3 
						1/2" drive will only break your disks. Obviously there is a problem here - how 
						do I get that software into my PC so an emulator can use it?
					</p>
					<p>
						It is possible to build special cartridge reading devices for console systems 
						and hook up old computers to new ones to transfer floppy disks. These media get 
						transferred into files on the new computer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, originally emulation was just for hobbyists who had all this special 
						equipment, but some of them put these BIOSes and images up on the Internet for 
						people to download, on the honor system that people would only download the 
						BIOSes and images that they owned the original software for. Unfortunately, a 
						lot of people came along who just wanted to download free games and did not care 
						about preservation, and gave the emulation community a bad name among software 
						companies. There are many BIOSes/images sites on the Internet, using a search 
						engine should turn up the ones you want. But remember: downloading pirated 
						BIOSes/images that you do not own is illegal. Some people say that the 
						copyrights have expired or that you can download it if you delete it after 24 
						hours, but they are wrong. It is up to you whether you want to ignore the law, 
						as most of the games are not and will not ever be sold again.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most systems require BIOSes. MESS is very picky about its BIOSes -- they must 
						be exactly the ones it is expecting, otherwise it may not work.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="s04">Okay, I got some BIOSes and images, now where do I put 
						them?</p>
        </h2>
					<p>
						BIOSes should go, still zipped, in the BIOS subfolder of wherever you put <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
							MESS</a>. Game images should go into the SOFTWARE\[system name] folder. 
						They can still be zipped, but only one image per zip file.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="s05">How do I start the MESS application?</h2>
					<p>
						For DOS, type "mess [system] [device] [game] [options]", where [system] is the 
						system driver name, [device] is the type of ROM, [game] is the filename of the 
						ROM, and options are command line options. Valid [device] names (eg -cart and 
						-flop) can be found by using "mess -listdevices" and valid options are listed 
						in the mess.txt and msdos.txt files.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example: <br> mess nes -cart zelda.nes -nosound (This will run the Zelda game on the 
						Nintendo system without sound. See mess.txt for more examples.
					</p>
					<p>
						For UNIX/Linux, do the same thing except the name of the program is xmess.
					</p>
					<p>
						For Macintosh or Windows OS, run the MacMESS or messgui.exe application and 
						click on the system or software you want to run.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="s06">I did everything just like you said, but it still does not 
						work!</p>
        </h2>
					<p>
						There is a message board you can go to for help at <a href="http://www.mess.org/">http://www.mess.org</a>. 
						But first, make sure you read this FAQ and the rest of the documentation. The 
						answers can often be found there. Also check out the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
							MAME</a> FAQ at <a href="http://www.mame.net/">http://www.mame.net</a> --it is 
						a very good resource for things common to <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>
						and <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, such as sound and graphics setup. 
						Also search through the message board to see if somebody already had the same 
						problem. And at least put some effort into fixing it yourself. People on 
						message boards can get very annoyed with people who ask questions that have 
						already been answered elsewhere, especially in readme.txt and mess.txt.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="s07">It works, but it is way too slow!</h2>
					<p>
						Because of <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>' goal of compatibility over 
						speed, this is often the case. You might think that your computer should be 
						able to emulate such old machines at full speed, but keep in mind that <a href="http://www.mess.org/">
							MESS</a> is not performing any shortcuts in the emulation. Many other 
						emulators perform shortcuts that sacrifice compatibility in favor of 
						performance, which is a valid tradeoff given a different set of design goals. 
						With <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>, your CPU is doing the jobs of the 
						CPU(s), graphics chip(s), sound chip(s), as well as any other special hardware 
						present in the original machine, so it can be bogged down fairly easily, 
						especially by the relatively unoptimized <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>
						core. <a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> is written almost entirely in C, 
						not assembly, for compatibility reasons. Additionally, there is a level of 
						overhead required to get the level of modularity that it takes to have the 
						myriad components in the emulation be usable across a broad set of drivers. 
						There are some tweaks you can do to speed up the performance a bit (see the <a href="http://www.mame.net/">
							MAME</a> FAQ), but if you need a big boost, there is not much you can do 
						except buy a faster computer, wait for an update (not likely), or use another 
						emulator.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="h01">How do I set up the screenshots/snapshots folder for 
						MESS?</h2>
					<p>
						The snapshot (aka screenshot) folder is the place to store images to be 
						displayed in the GUI. It can display in-game/software images and system images, 
						or anything else as long as it is named correctly.
					</p>
					<p>
						The snapshot folder can be configured in the Directories… window under the 
						Options menu in the GUI. The default screen folder is snap. Store system images 
						with the system name. Store software/game snapshots in a folder under the 
						system they belong to.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example:
						<br>
						mess/snap/a2600.png &lt;&lt;&lt; This is a picture of an Atari system. The name 
						needs to match the driver.<br>
						mess/snap/a2600/junglehunt.png &lt;&lt;&lt; This is an in-game screenshot of 
						the game Jungle Hunt. The name needs to match game name.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="h02">How do get screenshots?</h2>
					<p>
						You can take your own screen shots by selecting the ‘Save Screenshot’ option in 
						the file menu while in emulation. This will save an image in the png format 
						with the name of the driver (if one does not exist already). If an image 
						already exists an a sequential number will be added to the name (for example 
						coco.png, coco0000.png, coco0001.png etc...).
					</p>
					<p>
						You can also find many images on various emulation or download images from the 
						internet at various sites. Try your favorite search engine.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="h02">How do I contribute to the MESS project?</h2>
					<p>
						If you have programming skills, you can download the source and fix bugs, improve
						emulation on existing systems or add a new one! If you fix anything, be sure to 
						submit the fixes so they can be included in the source.	Be advised that corrections or
						additions may not be accepted if they are hackish in nature - MESS strives for 
						accuracy both in emulation and in the source code.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you do not have programming skills, you can help by documenting emulatad systems 
						and software, reporting bugs, submitting artwork and so on - anything to asssit 
						those with programming skills and improve the project.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="t01">Why don't you support a feature that allows the user to 
						remap their keyboard to the emulated system's, eliminating the need to adjust 
						to the system's keyboard layout?</h2>
					<p>
						We are working on this feature; the paste feature in <A href="http://www.mess.org/">
							MESS</A>  0.62 laid the foundation for this feature. Sit tight.
					</p>
					<h2 ID="t02">My English is not good. I do not understand!</h2>
					<p>
						If you ask for help on the message board, post it in both English and your 
						native language. Many people there speak more than one language and may be able 
						to help you in your native language. Also, visit <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com">
							http://babelfish.altavista.com</a>. They have a translation program that 
						can translate between English and most European languages as well as a number 
						of other languages. Also look at the MAME FAQ at <a href="http://www.mame.net">http://www.mame.net</a>. 
						It is in many different languages, including Greek, Serbian, Romanian, 
						Norwegian, Danish, Hebrew, Czech, Dutch, French, Italian, Korean, Japanese, 
						Chinese, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Finnish.
