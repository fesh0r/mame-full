                   ==========================================
                   
Please note that many people helped with this project, either directly or by
releasing source code which was used to write the drivers. We are not trying to
appropriate merit which isn't ours. See the acknowledgemnts section for a list
of contributors, however please note that the list is largely incomplete. See
also the CREDITS section in the emulator to see the people who contributed to a
specific driver. Again, that list might be incomplete. We apologize in advance
for any omission.

All trademarks cited in this document are property of their respective owners.

Especially, the MESS team would like to thank Nicola Salmoria and the MAME team 
for letting us play with their code and, in fact, incorporating MESS specific 
code into MAME.  Without it, MESS would be substantially less than what it is 
right now! ;-)


Usage and Distribution Licence:
===============================

- MESS usage and distribution follows that of MAME.  Please read the MAME 
  readme.txt file distributed with MESS for further information.



How to Contact The MESS Team
============================

Here are some of the people contributing to MESS. If you have comments,
suggestions or bug reports about an existing driver, check the driver's Credits
section to find who has worked on it, and send comments to that person. If you
are not sure who to contact, write to Ben (ben@netstra.com.au) - who is the 
current coordinator of the MESS project [DOS]. If you have comments specific to a
given operating system, they should be sent to the respective port maintainer.
You will find their e-mail address below.

PLEASE DON'T SEND BINARY ATTACHMENTS WITHOUT ASKING FIRST, *ESPECIALLY* ROM IMAGES.

THESE ARE NOT SUPPORT ADDRESSES. Support questions sent to these addresses
*will* be ignored. Please understand that this is a *free* project, mostly
targeted at experienced users. We don't have the resources to provide end user
support. Basically, if you can't get the emulator to work, you are on your own.
First of all, read this doc carefully. If you still can't find an answer to
your question, try checking the beginner's sections that many emulation pages
have, or ask on the appropriate Usenet newsgroups (e.g. comp.emulators.misc)
or on the many emulation message boards.  The official MESS message board is at:
          http://mess.emuverse.com


Also, DO NOT SEND REQUESTS FOR NEW SYSTEMS TO ADD, unless you have some original
info on the hardware or, even better, have the technical expertise needed to
help us. Please don't send us information widely available on the Internet -
we are perfectly capable of finding it ourselves, thank you.

MESS USAGE
==========

MESS <system> <[file1] [file2] [file...]> <options>

*For a complete list of systems emulated,  use: MESS -listfull
*For system files required by each system, use: MESS <system> -listroms
*See the MAME readme.txt for a detailed list of options.
*make sure you have roms in a subdirectory from your ROMPATH
 with the same name as the system (eg ROMS/COLECO)

Examples:

MESS nes zelda.nes
        will run MESS in the following way:
         <system>  = nes             (Nintendo Entertainment System) 
         <file1>   = zelda.nes       (Zelda cartridge)
         <options> = default options (all listed in mess.cfg)
	
MESS coleco dkong.rom -soundcard 0
        will run MESS in the following way:
         <system>  = coleco          (Nintendo Entertainment System) 
         <file1>   = dkong.rom       (Donkey Kong cartridge)
         <options> = default options but without sound
        
MESS trs80 boot.dsk arcade1.dsk
        will run MESS in the following way:
         <system>  = trs80           (TRs-80 model 1)
         <file1>   = boot.dsk        (The Trs80 boot diskl)
         <file2>   = arcade1.dsk     (Disk which contains games)
         <options> = default options (all listed in mess.cfg)
	
MESS cgenie games1.dsk
	will run the system Colour Genie with one disk image loaded
	


A NOTE ABOUT FILES:  
     - Place files to be loaded in a subdirectory from you rompath with the 
       same name as the system you want to run.  
       (eg) ROMPATH = C:\MESS\ROMS;
            The files for the coleco system would be placed here: 
                      C:\MESS\ROMS\COLECO

Supported Systems and Related Issues
====================================


a5200 - Atari 5200:
-------------------
Known Issues:
     - This driver is preliminary.  You can see the Atari system loadup screen,
       and a ROM will start, but the emulated system hangs...  If you can supply 
       info, please contact the MESS team! ;-)

     - The required System ROM (5200sys.bin - 2,048k - CRC 4248d3e3) is not listed
       in a MESS a5200 -listroms.  This file is required, and the system will not 
       run without it.


Compatibility:
     - This driver is preliminary and won't run past the demo screen.  
       Help is needed.





a7800 - Atari 7800:

Compatibility:
     - It should run just about anything you throw at it.
	





------------------------
amiga - Commodore Amiga:
------------------------
Known Issues:
     - NOT WORKING.  Problems introduced during the conversion to the 
       new MAME core :(   System begins to boot, but eventually hangs.



----------------------
amstrad - CPC Amstrad:
----------------------
Known Issues:
     - Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation 
       mode is enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, 
       some key associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for 
       EXIT).  The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the scroll_lock key.   

     - This system requires the SYSTEM BIOS to enable it to work.  To see what 
       file is required, type:
          MESS amstrad -listroms

Compatibility:
     - This driver is considered preliminary.  The system ROM is loaded, and the 
       Amstrad screen is shown.  Image loading is not supported yet.

---------------------
astrocde - Astrocade:
---------------------
Compatibility:
	It should run just about anything you throw at it.




----------------------	
cgenie - Colour Genie:
----------------------
Known Issues:
     - Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation 
       mode is enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, 
       some key associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for 
       EXIT).  The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the scroll_lock key.   

Usage:
	keyboard - relatively close to the original layout.
	joystick - emulation of dual Colour Genie joysticks with keypads.
	cassette - emulation of virtual tapes supported.
	    Use SYSTEM or CLOAD commands to read images.
	    SYSTEM supports 6 character filenames, CLOAD loads
	    a file named BASIC[N].CAS, where [N] is the character
	    you supplied (e.g. CLOAD"M" loads BASICM.CAS)
	floppies - emulation of virtual floppy discs supported.
	    Use CMD"I0" to "CMDI3" to get an inventory of drive 0 to 3,
	    use CMD"S FILENAME/CMD" to start a binary executable or use
	    LOAD"FILENAME/BAS" to load a basic program.

Options:
Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, there are three settings.
	"Floppy Disc Drives"  - enable or disable floppy disc controller.
	"DOS ROM C000-DFFF"   - enable 8K DOS ROM or make it RAM.
	"EXT ROM E000-EFFF"   - enable 4K Extension ROM or make it RAM.

Compatibility:
	The Colour Genie driver should run most of the known programs out there.
	It supports the Motorola 6845 CRT controller with text and graphics
	modes (LGR and FGR), the AY-3-8910 sound chip with three audio channels
	and noise and the WD 179x floppy disc controller with up to four
	virtual floppy disc drives contained in image files.

Known issues:
	Startup with CAS or CMD images does not always work. Use the BASIC
	SYSTEM or CLOAD commands to read cassette image files, or use
	the Colour Genie DOS ROM with floppy disc images to run programs.
	The driver does not yet emulate the printer port mode for AY-3-8910.
	Right now it always uses the AY-3-8910 ports for joystick emulation.

Notes:
The Colour Genie driver requires the presence of the following images:
	CGENIE.ROM      16K Basic and BIOS.
	CGENIE1.FNT     8x8 default character set with graphics.
To access the virtual floppy disc capabilities you need:
	CGDOS.ROM       8K Disk Operation System.
And as an add-on "DOS Interface" you can use:
	NEWE000.ROM     4K Extension
	


Additional info:
	Specify the disk image on the mess commandline.
		mess cgenie games1.dsk
		
	The newe000.rom is loaded if the corresponding "dip switch" is set 
	from the driver itself. No need to specify any roms on the commandline.
	
	Inside the emulation type:
		cmd"i
	to list the contents of the floppy disk image.
	To start a game, eg. paint/cmd, type
		cmd"s paint/cmd
	
	You can omit the blank between cmd"s and the filename..................
	
	
	This is how it also works:
		mess cgenie games1.dsk games2.dsk games3.dsk games4.dsk

	CLOAD is for BASIC type tapes only.  It should work if you have a 
	BASIC *.cas file. File "names" in that case are _one_ character in 
	length (inside the emulation).  In your roms/cgenie folder the 
	names will be basicA.cas, basicB.cas and so on.  If you CSAVE"A 
	you'll see a file basicA.cas laterand you can CLOAD"A it again. 
	
	To load a binary image there was a different command:
		SYSTEM
	You'll see a prompt looking like this:
		*?
	and there you can enter a name of up to six (wow!) characters.
		*?chop16<ENTER>
	will start loading a file named chop16.cas if it is in your rompath.
	If you don't have it... well, wait and see (nothing ;)  If you have 
	it, you'll see two stars (**) in the upper right corner.  The right 
	one will twinkle after every couple of bytes loaded, every 254 I 
	think.
	
	After several minutes you'll see the prompt again
		*?
	now type / (slash) and ENTER and the program will be started at it's
	defined run address. If a program does not have a run address, you 
	could also specify /<decimal value> to run from a specific value...

coco - Color Computer:
---------------------
Known Issues:
     - Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation 
       mode is enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, 
       some key associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for 
       EXIT).  The keyboard emulation mode is toggled using the scroll_lock key.   



	
----------------------
coleco - ColecoVision:
----------------------
Usage:
	arrow keys - 1p move
	ctrl, alt - 1p fire
	1-0 - number keys on the Colecovision controller
	minus - '#' key on the Colecovision controller
	equals - '.' key on the Colecovision controller

Compatibility:
	To the best of my knowledge, this emulation should run any cartridge
	accurately.

Notes:
	The Colecovision driver requires the presence of "COLECO.ROM".  The driver
	will not function without this ROM.  A real Colecovision also will not
	function without this ROM.

Thanks:
	Special thanks to Marat Fayzullin for providing loads of Colecovision
	information through the ColEm source.

     - This system requires the SYSTEM BIOS to enable it to work.  To see what 
       file is required, type:
          MESS ep128 -listroms

Compatibility:
     - This driver is considered preliminary.  The system ROM is loaded, and the 
       Enterprise screen is shown.  Image loading is not supported yet.

----------------------------------------------
genesis - Genesis (MegaDrive in Japan/Europe):
----------------------------------------------
Usage:
	arrow keys - 1p move
	control, alt - 1p fire
	1,2 - 1, 2 player select
	return - 1p start

Options:
	Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, you will find the
	following option:

	"Country" - this allows you to alter the 'flavour' of Genesis, to either European,
	            Japanese or American. Many cartridges compare their country codes with
	            that of the Genesis itself and may behave differently, or lock up if the
	            two types do not match.
	            'Auto' attempts to auto-set the Genesis country code to the value the
	            cartridge will appear to be checking for. This may not be 100% accurate,
	            however.

Compatibility:
	Most games tend to run fairly well. some with slight graphic glitches, incorrect
	colours part way down the screen or other b'zarre effects.

	Cartridges up to 32MBit (4MByte) are supported.

	The controller may not work well with some games. This will be resolved when I
	obtain more information. Similarly, 6-button joypads aren't emulated yet.

	Split screen effects and interlacing are not yet supported.

	Sprite/layer priority should be perfect.

	Sound is emulated at Z80 and PSG76489 level. There is no inbuilt YM2612 support,
	this will follow on soon using software FM synthesis.  

Notes:
	I still consider the Genesis driver extremely preliminary. I have a lot of further
	work to do before I consider it anywhere near complete. My initial goal is to make
	it as compatible as possible. Currently there is scope within the driver to handle
	split screen colour changes/any VDP effect, interlacing, without rewriting. The
	graphics renderer emulates VDP at scanline level, and does not use tile-based
	methods.
	
Wanted:
	Any Sega Megadrive information! Information is extremely sparse; typically the same
	three-four documents, with parts incomplete, conflicting, and corrupted. Specifically,
	some of the finer points of DMA transfer, and access of the 68K memory map by the Z80.
	Generally, points which conflict with themselves in the documentation available on
	the net...

Thanks:
	...which I'm thankful for, as there certainly isn't any source available to look at!
	Thanks to the rest of the MESS team, Terence & Philip and the MAME team, Kevin Lingley
	for support and ex(p|t)ensive games testing in this driver's ARM code & early forms,
	and, of course, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny...
	
	Please note that no goats were sacrificed during the development of this driver.

Known Issues:
     - Requires full keyboard emulation.  At startup, full keyboard emulation 
       mode is enabled by default.  Whilst in full keyboard emulation mode, 
       some key associated functionality may be disabled (like the ESC key for

------------------------------------
nes - Nintendo Entertainment System:
------------------------------------
Usage:
	arrow keys - 1p move
	control, alt - 1p fire
	1,2 - 1, 2 player select
	return - 1p start

	
Options:
	Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, are two settings.
	"Renderer" - can be set to Scanline or Experimental. The Scanline renderer gives
	             the most accurate display, but can be slow. The Experimental
	             option is much faster, but still needs quite a bit of work before it
	             displays properly in all cases. It's best used for games with no
	             scrolling playfields, like Donkey Kong, etc.
	"Split-Screen fix" - defaults to off. Turn it on to see proper split screens in
	             games like Kirby's Adventure and Airwolf. This will most likely go
	             away in the future as we figure out how these split screens really work.

Compatibility:
    The NES driver should run 99% of the ROMs currently out there with very little problem.
    It doesn't yet support a lot of the obscure mappers used in fwNES, but this is on deck
    for the next release. For the record, it supports mappers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (incomplete),
    7, 8, 9 & 10 (incomplete), 11, 15, 16, 18 (vrom probs), 25 (vrom probs), 33, 34,
    64, 65, 66, 68 (incomplete), 69 (incomplete), 71, 78, 79.
    Some of the mappers > 63 haven't been fully tested yet.
    
Notes:
    The main focus up until this point has been in getting the NES driver as accurate
    as possible. Unfortunately, the scanline rendering method is quite slow, so future
    efforts will be focusing on bringing up the speed. Also, the sound code is still a
    bit shaky. However, the NES driver does have quite accurate sample playback. For example,
    you can hear speech samples in Bayou Billy, Gauntlet, Dirty Harry, and Skate or Die
    that are not present in a few other NES emulators.
    
Wanted:
	I'd appreciate any info on some of the more obscure mappers. If you have
	any of this, please drop me a line at bradman@primenet.com.
	
Thanks:
	Special thanks to Nicolas Hamel for xNES. Also, thanks to Marat Fayzullin, D,
	Icer Addis, Matt Conte, Arthur Langereis, and John Stiles for tips and moral support 
        during the development of the NES driver. And last but not least, thanks to Jeremy 
        Chadwick and Firebug for their respective NES docs, without which this driver would 
        have taken considerably longer. I'll be sending you guys updates for both files 
        soon. ;)

Compatibility:
    It's not very compatible right now. The code is still quite preliminary. It should run
    most of the ROMs, but quite a few exhibit graphics glitches. The MasterSystem has
    totally incorrect color also. Sound emulation appears to be near perfect though.

	cassette - emulation of virtual tapes supported.
	    Use SYSTEM or CLOAD commands to read images.
	    SYSTEM supports 6 character filenames and loads the
	    corresponding FILENM.CAS image, CLOAD loads a file named
	    BASIC[N].CAS, where [N] is the character you supplied
	    (e.g. CLOAD"M" loads BASICM.CAS)
	floppies - emulation of virtual floppy discs supported.
	    Use a NEWDOS/80 boot disk for drive 0 and set up correct
	    PDRIVE parameters for the other drives.
	    If only drives 0 to 2 are used they can be double sided
	    by interpreting drive select 3 as head select bit.

Options:
Under the "Options" menu, accessible by hitting TAB, there are three settings.
	"Floppy Disc Drives"  - enable or disable floppy disc controller.
	"Video RAM"           - enable upper case only or upper/lower font.
	"Virtual E000-EFFF"   - enable 4K Extension ROM or make it RAM.

Compatibility:
	The TRS-80 driver should run most of the known programs out there.
	It supports a WD 179x floppy disc controller with up to four
	virtual floppy disc drives contained in image files.

Notes:
The TRS-80 driver requires the presence of the following images:
	TRS80.ROM       12K Level II Basic.
	TRS80.FNT       6x15 default character set with block graphics.

vectrex - Vectrex:
------------------
Usage:

Compatibility:
	To the best of our knowledge, this emulation should run most cartridges
	accurately.

Notes:
	The Vectrex driver requires the presence of "SYSTEM.IMG".  The driver
	will not function without this ROM.  A real Vectrex also will not
	function without this ROM. Also, overlay support is present now!

Thanks:
	Special thanks to Keith Wilkins and Chris Salomon for their work on DVE
	and their help,	without which this driver would have taken much longer.
