Rockwell AIM-65
---------------

very early computer 


Features
--------
integrated 20 digit (16segment) display 
full size keyboard
integrated printer
connector for tty input/output
type interface


Mess Emulation State
--------------------
display, keyboard working
Useable picture of the the display with its white frame as artwork would be nice.
Would suffer from support for intelligent terminals as tty equipment.
Stopped. For me it is much to cryptic to operate, and therefor not interesting
for me anymore.
