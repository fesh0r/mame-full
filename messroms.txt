messroms utility
----------------

motivation: help identifying already known roms, bad dumps,
and give info to convert roms into the needed format.

messroms --0x0000000 
 identify crc 
messroms directory
 identifies files in directory
messroms zipfile.zip
 identifies files in zip archiv


dumping roms
------------

most roms are dumped with eprom burners.
There are many variations of eprom burners outside,
each supported a large range of eprom chip types.

I will give only a few tips for special chips:

Always use the romcmp utility to identify bad dumps.
Dump several times, and compare if the dumped data is the same.

MOS6332: rom 4 kbyte 8bit, DIL 24 package
 for pinout look into mess/messroms/read6332.c
 to allow dumping as 2732 build an adapter exchanging pin 18 and 20
 
MOS6530: rom, ram, input, output timer
 difficult to read
 look into mess/messroms/read6530.c
 maybe you can wire an adapter for an eprommer and read it as 27128 (a0 simulating clock)
 you have to identify the rom, ram, io area in the usually 8kbyte dumped data
 ram 64 bytes 0xff, io 16 bytes misc data, rom 1kbyte, 
 unused depends on your hardware in mine 0

EPROM DIL 32 PIN:
 dumping as 278001 should be save

PIC1655
 info at www.microchip.com: technical reference manual and programming reference manual
 available

 could be protected (you read protected data, with info lost)
 reading of mask programmed chips?
 PIC16C55 and PIC1655(NMOS) differences?

SC61860: Sharp Pocket Computer internal rom of the cpu
 not known if it is accessible on the pinout

RCA Studio 2 and cartridges
 look at Paul Robson's Studio2 page at www.classicgaming.com/studio2

Watara Supervision Cartridges
 look into mess/messroms/svision.txt for building an adapter

Saving roms
-----------

Some dump roms with the help of rom sockets in computer.
E.g. pc network adapter to plug in an 8kbyte rom in its bootrom socket
and read it.

Sometimes it is not possible to get the single chips for reading.
* you may not or can not open the appliances
* roms are soldered directly into the board and you cannot unsolder them
* roms are in a smd package with very small place between pins
....

Many roms are complete visible to cpu. So you can read them out with programs.

IBMPC
-----
most bios, graphics, harddisk, ethernet bootroms are complete visible.
Character roms in pre EGA graphics adapters are not visible.
Flash roms of modern pcs not complete in the small 256 kbyte PC realmode area.
Some special roms (deskmate of tandy1000) are not visible in the small 256kbyte area.

You can used msdos debug, or any other debugger to save there roms:
c0000-c7fff typical EGA,VGA
c8000-c9fff typical PC harddisk controller
f6000-fdfff BASIC
fe000-fffff PC bios
f0000-fffff bigger bios

In dumppc.zip you find a msdos utility dumping the complete c0000-fffff area.

Sharp Pocket Computer
---------------------
look into src/cpu/sc61860/readpc.c
Internal rom only accessible in machine language


Transfering data to another computer
