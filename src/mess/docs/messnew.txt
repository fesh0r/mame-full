New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
Spectrum +2 (France) [David Robertson]
Spectrum +2 (Spain) [David Robertson]
Spectrum +3 (Spain) [David Robertson]
BBC Micro Model B (preliminary) [Gordon Jefferyes]
Vic20 with IEEE488 interface cartridge [Peter Trauner]
PCW [Kev Thacker]


System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- VECTREX: Support for true color artwork added [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- SPECTRUM: .TAP loading on TS2068 now works, and fixed bug where the last byte 
  in .Z80 blocks was not decoded - Head Over Heels now works. 
  .TAP files now classified as cassettes files not snapshots because of how they are 
  used - this now means they appear on Tape Control menu, corrected clock speed of 
  TS2068, fixed Issue 2/3 dipswitch implementation, dipswitch to enable/disable disk 
  drives on +3 and clones (disabling disk drives on +3 correctly shows machine as +2a 
  on start up menu). implemented TS2068/TC2048 64 column and hires modes, rewrote 
  Spectrum 128 screen refresh to use plot_pixel for a major speedup. 
  Fixed bug that created a new file if trying to use a non-existant .TAP file, modified 
  border size based on the comp.sys.sinclair FAQ (48 pixels at the left, right and top 
  and 56 pixels at the bottom of the screen, initial support for border colour - fills 
  entire border with last the outputted colour, border colour set when loading snapshots.
  Added a Border Engine to all Spectrum machines. [David Robertson]

- C65: added m4510 core, memory management changed and keyboard finished, DMA 
  controller enhanced, quickloader fixed, added floppy simulation for devices 10,11, 
  very early support of special c65/vic3 videomodes, (on the funet disks are only some 
  graphic demos, works when you change disk access (bload, loadiff) to:
  bload "name",u10
  loadiff "name",u10
  (load with dload"name",u10 or load"name",10)
  (and change the names to 8 letters in msdos.  [Peter Trauner]

- C16: emulated flashing mode of the TED chip, activated and fixed blinking. 
  Disabled blinking in multicolor modes (winter edition) [Peter Trauner]

- PC series: Changed osd_modify_pen calls to palette_change_color.  Emulation of the 
  EGA/VGA palette registers in tandy1000 video driver, vga palette management fix,
  changed drivername to t1000hx (rename your romset from tandy1t), added eeprom 
  support (fixes disk support), added turboswitch functionality, changed frequency 
  to 8 MHz, removed some dipswitches.  [Peter Trauner]

- CoCo/Dragon/MC-10: Better .CAS file support, now supports cassette writes, 
  slightly better .PAK file support. [Nate Woods]

- CoCo: Now uses the standard wd179x code.  As a result, src/mess/machine/cocodisk.c 
  is not necessary anymore, implemented 63.5usec horizontal sync interrupt 
  (Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), implemented secondary fire buttons for both joysticks 
  (Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), keyboard interrupt (CoCo 3). [Nate Woods]

- CBM: cbm floppy drive simulation names for file system access changed, floppy disk 
  simulation for pet series (not working with first pet and superpet), added 8096 memory 
  expansion to cbm80 series, and cartridge/rom support in pet and cbmb series.
  [Peter Trauner]

- MTX: Cassette support can now handle multiple files in the same image, and country cde 
  (CTYLST) Dipswitches now implemented. [Lee Ward]

- Updated Amstrad and Enterprise driver with correct aspect ratio, updates to the KC85/4 
  driver including code to emulate the keyboard - works by poking OS system variables.
  [Kev Thacker]


Other Changes:
--------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.37b3. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- Bug fix in wd179x controller [Nate Woods]

- Bug fix in the wave handler (when image is closed, osd_fclose() is now called 
  on the file descriptor [Nate Woods]

- Bug fix in the tape control that cause the control to give percentage erros when 
  using *.cas files. [Nate Woods]

- ImgTool: Preliminary PC Hard drive driver, better error reporting, a new command 
  ('good') that functions as a rom sorter (a la GoodNes).  CRC information is retrieved 
  from the standard MESS CRC files, the 'crc' command is replaced with 'info'.  This new 
  command will return data regarding the image if MESS's CRC files are aware of the 
  image. dir and del now can take multiple arguments. [Nate Woods]

- Extensive CRC updates.

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- PC: Mouse now very usable, PC CGA scrolling support in 320x200x2 fixed 
  (Boulderdash), Tandy1000 Graphics memory switching enchanced (Lemmings), 
  Joystick changes (slow autocenter remaining), added xtcga with mf2 keyboard 
  and turbo switch, split the xtvga in xtega (vga with ega monitor), and added 
  palette handling to ega/vga. [Peter Trauner]

- C364: preliminary speech added (similar hardware in the C64 
  cartridge Magic Voice, used in few programs). [Peter Trauner]

- C128: Esc-x to switch c128 to 40 column mode. Keypad enter to switch 
  emulator to 40 column mode. In the input keys configuration menu you 
  should find several key assignments with normal (not reversed)T.  Change 
  these to another key, and the normal T will work. (in the system file 
  these keys are disabled, until I find a better solution) [Peter Trauner]

- MACPLUS: driver boots (must use the 68k C core) [Nate Woods]

- SEGA MASTER SYSTEM: Rewrite of the SMS video code, so quite a lot of games with
  interrupt problems or corrupt graphics run fine now. [Charles MacDonald]

- SPECTRUM: Added support for 128K .SNA and .Z80 files, ensured that the 48K Basic 
  ROM is paged in when running 48K snapshots on 128K machine (for improved 
  reliability and access to the default character set), changed +3 initialisation, 
  128 and +3 now set 0x4000-0x7fff to bank 5 (Now not changed if switching to shadow 
  screen), cleaned up spectrum_plus3_update_memory, fixed bug in decoding uncompressed 
  v2+ .Z80 files, and changed running speed of 128K Machines to 3.54690MHz
  [David Robertson]

- COMMODORE: cbmdrive (memory freeing) fixed, cia6526 tod fix, c128fra fix, 
  50 hertz machines now really have 50 hz video refresh, c16 1551 simulation fixed 
  [Peter Trauner]

- DRAGON series: Now supports a new variant of the .PAK file format for snapshots.
  [Nate Woods]

- TI99:  Mini Memory Support (rename minimemc.bin to minimemm.bin for it to 
  work correctly), fixed a bug in banked roms when a hard reset (F3) is done, rom 
  images are now identified by their filename extensions (image order isn't important 
  anymore), no need to use NUL when no grom image, both alt -> fctn and both ctrl -> ctrl 
  added, and new rom image extensions (.c .d .m .g .crom. drom. mrom .grom).
  [Norberto Alfredo Bensa]

- A7800: Support for bankswitched carts and carts with extra RAM, added 160B video mode, 
  increased screen height to fix clipping at bottom, updated header format (details can be 
  found in machine/a7800.c), added support for light gun trigger (not the light gun 
  targetting yet, just the trigger), and removed requirment for a cartridge (since the 7800 
  starts in the BIOS it doesn't technically need a cartridge) [Dan Boris]




Other Changes:
--------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.37b2. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- TOOLS: Disk Utility added (mkhdimg.exe) which will create variable sized HD images 
  for use in MESS.  Can create images from 9,216 bytes to 142,606,848 bytes 
  without problems.  The Western Digital 1004A that is emulated in MESS is 
  limited to 1024 Cylinders and 16 heads. The sector size is limited to 512 
  bytes as well as the sectors per track being limited to 17, this is also 
  due to the WD1004A's limitations. [Randy Rains]

- TOOLS: Generic image tool added (imgtool.exe) with the following features:
  *MAME/MESS style driver architecture; where the image formats are contained in drivers.  
   Currently, the only driver is for CoCo .DSK disk images, but there could be more.
  *Runs on the command line.
  *Commands for listing image contents, retrieving and storing files.
  *Supports images in .ZIP files.
  *"Engine" is separate from the "shell"; which gives the potential for front ends for 
   those who don't like command lines. [Nate Woods]

- Disk write support for AMSTRAD CPC [Oscar Martín González]

- Wave timer fix [Oscar Martín González]

- m6510t/m7501/m8502 CPU cores added [Peter Trauner]

- Extensive CRC updates.
