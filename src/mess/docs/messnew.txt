0.36b6

PLEASE NOTE: MESS is now developed and distributed as a MAME source 
override, hence the MESS version number leap ;-) There are many 
advantages to developing MESS this way, however, one major downside was 
that *all* the previous MESS system drivers had to be modified for the 
new MAME cores. So, as a consequence, not all systems work properly in 
this release, and THERE ARE SYSTEMS IN THIS RELEASE WHICH *MAY* HAVE 
PROBLEMS THAT DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. We have tried our best to ensure that 
all the drivers from the last release are working as good as before (in 
most cases better), but there is no guarantee.

Enjoy!  Please report all problems to the message board at:

New drivers supported (in no particular order):
-----------------------------------------------

Amstrad CPC [Kevin Thacker]
Atari 7800 [Dan Boris]
Commodore Amiga [Ernesto Corvi]
Dragon 32 [Mathis Rosenhauer]
EACA Colour Genie 2000 [Mathis Rosenhauer]
Enterprise 128K [Kevin Thacker]
KC Compact [Kevin Thacker]
PC-Engine / Turbo Graphics-16 [Charles Mac Donald]
PC-compatible (MDA, CGA) [Juergen Buchmueller]
RA+A Spectrum I+ [Mathis Rosenhauer]
TI-994a [Raphael Nabet]
ZX-Spectrum 48k [Allard van der Bas]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Misc. mapper and PPU fixes for the NES. [Brad Oliver, Firebug, Fx3]

- Rewrite of Sega MasterSystem/GameGear code. It is now much more playable
  than before. [Charles Mac Donald]

- Better color imager support for the Vectrex. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Vectrex Driver overlay support. [Mathis Rosenhauer]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Adjusted timing of NES clock to be accurate. [Brad Oliver]

- Sound in the Astrocade driver. [Frank Palazzolo]

- Preliminary Mockingboard support for the Apple II. [Brad Oliver]

- Genesis sound improvements. [Gareth Long]

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Several drivers have had compatibility improved (eg. NES, Genesis and Coleco)

- The Apple II drivers have been fleshed out a little more. The //e
  family now works. The disk emulation is significantly faster as well.
  There is still plenty of work to be done though. [Brad Oliver]

- Bug fixes to the TI9928a video code. This affects the ColecoVision and the
  TI-994a drivers. [Raphael Nabet, Sean Young]

- There are major keyboard problems with most of the emulated computer
  systems (eg apple2, kaypro, ti99).  This is known, and we are looking 
  into it.  


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.36b6. [MAME team]

- Zipped cart and image support added. To use, make sure that the zip has the
  same name as the file in the zip. (eg) for a coleco CART called
  "venture.rom", zip to "venture.zip".  When running MESS, type "mess coleco
  venture.rom".  MESS will then load "venture.rom" from "venture.zip".  Any
  system roms can also be zipped and placed anywhere in you ROMPATH. (eg)
  coleco.rom in coleco.zip.
  [Ben Bruscella]

- GAME_COMPUTER flag added.  Use this to specify that the system requires
  full keyboard emulation.  Emulated Computer systems now use the 
  scroll_lock key to toggle the keyboard emulation.  When on, MAME keys 
  (such as "P" for pause) are disabled, until toggled with the scroll_lock.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] MAKEFILE/compilation changes. To compile MESS, simply make sure you
  can compile MAME. Then, apply the MESS source over-ride and:

   1. Rename MAKEFILE to MAKEFILE.mm
   2. Rename MAKEFILE.MES MAKEFILE
   3. Type MAKE

  The goal is to have no MAME files over-written to compile MESS, although
  this may not be possible for every release.

- Basically, theres too much to keep track of here since the last release!   
  Documentation will return to normal next release ;-)


==========================================================================


0.2b4

Note that this is the first public beta - not all features are working 
yet.

New drivers supported (in no particular order):
-----------------------------------------------

Vectrex [Mathis Rosenhauer, Chris Salomon]
Atari 800/5200 [Juergen Buchmueller]
Apple II Family [Mike Balfour]
PDP/1 [Chris Salomon]
Sega Master System [Mathis Rosenhauer, Brad Oliver]
Sega GameGear [Mathis Rosenhauer, Brad Oliver]
Kaypro CP/M [Juergen Buchmueller, Benjamin C. W. Sittler]
Bally Astrocade [Frank Palazzolo]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- The TRS-80 now uses the real character prom data. [Mike Balfour]



These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- NES psg frequency is now correct. [Brad Oliver]

- Genesis now features preliminary FM sound. [Gareth Long, Tatsuyuki Satoh]



Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- General bug fixes to the TRS-80, Colour Genie. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Increased Genesis compatibility. [Gareth Long]



Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Code is in sync with MAME 0.33 final + some extras. All bug fixes to the core
  are incorporated.

- New 6502 core with support for the 65c02 and 6510 variants. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- The 6809 core has been tweaked to increase cycle counting accuracy, needed
  for the Vectrex. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- The core key functions have been abstraced to make better use of the
  keyboard. This is especially handy for computer emulations. [Aaron Giles]



Source:
-------

- The DOS version is now compiled with GCC 2.8.1 and using Allegro 3.0 + WIP
  (30th May).

- [DOS] To improve portability, the makefile is more conservative, using the
  -pedantic and -Wshadow switches. Note that to compile with these switches,
  several changes had to be made to allegro.h, which is included.
