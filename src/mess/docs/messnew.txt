New drivers supported (in no particular order):
-----------------------------------------------
GameBoy (preliminary)  [Carsten Sorensen, Marat Fayzullin,
                       Pascal Felber, Hans de Goede, 
                       Juergen Buchmueller]
TI99_4 (not working)           [Raphael Nabet]
CP400                          [Nate Woods]



These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Support added for CoCo 3 hires graphics [Nate Woods]

- Fixes to the cgenie vidhrdw code. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Trs80, removed video x*2/y*3 hacks. The character layout is now 
  6x12.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- VZ fixes [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed the color graphics modes for Dragon/CoCo2. 
  [Nate Woods, Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Minor improvements to the graphics display in the amstrad driver. 
  A border is shown and the screen is centralised in the horizontal. 
  Vertical centering not done properly done yet.  Graphics routines 
  use plot_pixel so work in 8-bit and 16-bit colour. [Kev Thacker]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- n/a


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- amstrad disk image support!  thanks to nec765 floppy disc controller 
  emulation.  This provides loading of disk images in the CPCEMU 
  standard and extended disk image formats (the most common format 
  available on the net)  [Kev Thacker]

- Changed the cgenie driver to use the opbaseoverride() to load a 
  .cas file from the command line. This works for unprotected, binary
  *.cas files only, though.  From inside the emulation you can still 
  load binary images with the SYSTEM command and BASIC files with 
  CLOAD"<letter>.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed some minor cgenie problems, like loading *.cas files from 
  inside the emulation with names shorter than 6 characters.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- KIM-1 driver works without backdrop now [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Kaypro 2x works again [Juergen Buchmueller]

- TRS80, fixed .cas/.cmd loader using opbaseoverride(). The image is 
  loaded as soon as the BASIC prompt is show (">" in line 4) and 
  floppy controller is disabled in trs80_init() when no floppy disk
  image is specified.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Jupiter Ace now includes support for .ace and .tap files.
  [Paul Daniels]

- Tapes are loaded again in the Dragon32 [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Number of PC and clone fixes [Juergen Buchmueller]

Note: .inp record/playback does still not work currently.


New drivers supported (in no particular order):
-----------------------------------------------
- MSX [Sean Young]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Jupiter - modified the vidhrdw code to use drawgfx() instead of 
  modifying the bitmap's single pixels, corrected the GfxLayout for 
  jupiter_charlayout and used it with decodechar() whenever the 
  character set is changed in jupiter_charram_w(), and changed to the 
  generic videoram/videoram_size/videoram_w and dirtybuffer variables 
  and functions (note how they are initialized in the writememory 
  definition).  You can now see the current character set with UI and 
  F4.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

  better but still not perfect handling of the keyboard.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Enabled the Disk Basic ROM (disk.rom) for the CoCo and CoCo 3
  [Nathan]

- Memory manager modifications in the dragon32 drivers that allow the 
  use of a true CoCo 3 ROM and modifications to the ROM table that 
  use a true CoCo 3 ROM. [Nathan]

- Simple tape support in the CBM driver (press play on tape with f5 
  key) [Peter Trauner]

- Fewer IO errors when loading tape images (dragon driver) 
  [Mathis Rosenhauer]



Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

  [thanx go to JOJO for excellent bug reports]
- Fixed the -listinfo crash

- Corrected the -listdetails output

- listroms now produces correct output for all drivers 

- All GUI instances of "GAME" replaced with "MACHINE"



Source:

- The core is based on MAME 0.36b7. This incorporates all features 
  of the update to this core (such as sidewinder fixes).  [MAME team]

- Aliases now supported again!  Just to remind everyone, it allows 
  you to specify a set of ROMs or disk images with a short name in 
  the mess.cfg file.
  eg.:
  [trs80]
  arcade = boot.dsk,arcade1.dsk,arcade2.dsk,arcade3.dsk

  You can then call 'mess trs80 arcade' and have all four disks 
  inserted instead of typing the full command line.

- You can now specify in MESS.CFG the *exact* directory a rom is 
  which you want to run.  no longer necessray to have a directory with 
  the same name as the system [Juergen Buchmueller] 
  
- 'clone' systems now supported.  The system BIOS is loaded from 
  either the parent set (zipped) or the clone set (same as MAME).  
  Roms/Images can reside in either the parent or clone subdirectory. 
  [Ben Bruscella]





===================================================================

0.36b6

PLEASE NOTE: MESS is now developed and distributed as a MAME source 
override, hence the MESS version number leap ;-) There are many 
advantages to developing MESS this way, however, one major downside was 
that *all* the previous MESS system drivers had to be modified for the 
new MAME cores. So, as a consequence, not all systems work properly in 
this release, and THERE ARE SYSTEMS IN THIS RELEASE WHICH *MAY* HAVE 
PROBLEMS THAT DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. We have tried our best to ensure that 
all the drivers from the last release are working as good as before (in 
most cases better), but there is no guarantee.

Enjoy!  Please report all problems to the message board at:

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Misc. mapper and PPU fixes for the NES. [Brad Oliver, Firebug, Fx3]

- Rewrite of Sega MasterSystem/GameGear code. It is now much more playable
  than before. [Charles Mac Donald]

- Better color imager support for the Vectrex. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Vectrex Driver overlay support. [Mathis Rosenhauer]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Adjusted timing of NES clock to be accurate. [Brad Oliver]

- Sound in the Astrocade driver. [Frank Palazzolo]

- Preliminary Mockingboard support for the Apple II. [Brad Oliver]

- Genesis sound improvements. [Gareth Long]



Other driver changes:
----------------------

- Several drivers have had compatibility improved (eg. NES, Genesis and Coleco)

- The Apple II drivers have been fleshed out a little more. The //e
  family now works. The disk emulation is significantly faster as well.
  There is still plenty of work to be done though. [Brad Oliver]

- Bug fixes to the TI9928a video code. This affects the ColecoVision and the
  TI-994a drivers. [Raphael Nabet, Sean Young]

- There are major keyboard problems with most of the emulated computer
  systems (eg apple2, kaypro, ti99).  This is known, and we are looking 
  into it.  


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.36b6. [MAME team]

- Zipped cart and image support added. To use, make sure that the zip has the
  same name as the file in the zip. (eg) for a coleco CART called
  "venture.rom", zip to "venture.zip".  When running MESS, type "mess coleco
  venture.rom".  MESS will then load "venture.rom" from "venture.zip".  Any
  system roms can also be zipped and placed anywhere in you ROMPATH. (eg)
  coleco.rom in coleco.zip.
  [Ben Bruscella]

- GAME_COMPUTER flag added.  Use this to specify that the system requires
  full keyboard emulation.  Emulated Computer systems now use the 
  scroll_lock key to toggle the keyboard emulation.  When on, MAME keys 
  (such as "P" for pause) are disabled, until toggled with the scroll_lock.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] MAKEFILE/compilation changes. To compile MESS, simply make sure you
  can compile MAME. Then, apply the MESS source over-ride and:

   1. Rename MAKEFILE to MAKEFILE.mm
   2. Rename MAKEFILE.MES MAKEFILE
   3. Type MAKE

  The goal is to have no MAME files over-written to compile MESS, although
  this may not be possible for every release.

- Basically, theres too much to keep track of here since the last release!   
  Documentation will return to normal next release ;-)

  (30th May).

- [DOS] To improve portability, the makefile is more conservative, using the
  -pedantic and -Wshadow switches. Note that to compile with these switches,
  several changes had to be made to allegro.h, which is included.
