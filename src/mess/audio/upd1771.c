    NEC uPD1771 as used in the Epoch Super Cassette Vision (SCV)

    Made using recording/analysis on a Yeno (PAL Super Cassete Vision)
    by plgDavid

    Full markings on my 2 specimens are "NEC JAPAN 8431K9 D1771C 017"
    31th week of 1984, mask rom #017

    Ive seen mentions of a 006, 011 and 015 on part miner sites.
    Since the chip generates tones using embeded wavetables,
    it is probable other sounds are possible and were made for other embeded systems.
    Its anyone's guess at this point in which products.

    upd17XXX devices are typically 4bit NEC MCUs, so it wouldnt be a stretch to
    say that this chip is part of that lot.
    Maybe mask roms 006,011 and 015 dont generate audio at all.

     Used pinout in the SCV:

     NC           1        28        NC
     NC           2        27        NC
     NC           3        26        ACK
    !WR           4        25        D7
    !CS           5        24        D6
     RESET        6        23        D5
     NC           7        22        D4
     VCC          8        21        D3
     6Mhz XIN     9        20        D2
     6Mhz XOUT   10        19        D1
     AUDOUT      11        18        D0
     NC          12        17        GND
     AUDOUT(inv) 13        16        VCC
     GND         14        15        ? tied to pin 16 (VCC) through a resistor (pullup?)

    In the SCV:
    pin  5 is tied to the !SCPU pin on the Epoch TV chip pin 29 (0x3600 writes)
    pin  6 is tied to the   PC3 pin of the upD7801 CPU
    pin 26 is tied to the  INT1 pin of the upD7801 (CPU pin 12),

    1,2,3,28,27 dont generate any digital signals
    6 seems to be lowered 2.5 ms before an audio write
    7  is always low.
    12 is always high

    It is unknown which is the "real" VCC input betwwen pin 8 and 16,
    same goes for GNDs on pin 14 and 17.

    Pins 11 and 13 go to a special circuit, which according to kevtris's analysis
    of my schematics, consist of a balanced output (not unlike XLR cables),
    which are then combined togheter then sent to the RF box.

    All NC pins are unknown, maybe some are  "test" pins.

    All writes are made through address 0x3600 on the upD7801
    Instead of using register=value, this chip require sending multiple
    bytes for each command, one after the other.

/*
*************TONE*****************
Tone consist of a wavetable playback mechanism.
Each wavetable is a looping period of 32 samples but can be played with an offset from any point in the table
effectively shrinking the sample loop, thus allowing different pitch "macros ranges" to be played.
This method is rather crude because the spectrum of the sound get heavily altered...
unless that was the intent.

Tone Write (4 bytes):

Byte0: 0x02

Byte1: 0bTTTOOOOO
  MSB 3 bits of Timbre (8 wavetables)
  LSB 5 bits offset in the table.

Byte2: 0bPPPPPPPP
  8bits of clock divider/period
  Anything under <= 0x20 give the same value

Byte3: 0b???VVVVV
   MSB 3 bits unknown
   LSB 5 bits of "Volume"

   Note: volume is not a volume in a normal sense but some kind
   of bit cropping/rounding.
*/

/*
*************NOISE*****************
Noise consists on 4 different components
A weird Wavetable LFSR (for lack of a better term),
and three independent (but equal) low frequency
50/50 pulse wavs.

The 4 components are mixed in a mysterious way,
a weird ORing with volume having a huge effect.

Byte0: 0x01

Byte1: 0bTTTOOOOO
  MSB 3 bits of LFSR Timbre (8 wavetables)
  LSB 5 bits ?????????

Byte2: 0bPPPPPPPP
  8bits of clock divider/period

Byte3: 0b???VVVVV
   MSB 3 bits unknown
   LSB 5 bits of "Volume"


Byte4: 0bPPPPPPPP  Low Freq0 period(if not 0 this peridically resets the  Wavetable LFSR)
Byte5: 0bPPPPPPPP  Low Freq1 period(if not 0 this peridically resets the  Wavetable LFSR)
Byte6: 0bPPPPPPPP  Low Freq2 period(if not 0 this peridically resets the  Wavetable LFSR)

Byte7: 0b???VVVVV  Low Freq0 volume
Byte8: 0b???VVVVV  Low Freq1 volume
Byte9: 0b???VVVVV  Low Freq2 volume
