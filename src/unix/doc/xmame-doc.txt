Introduction

Welcome to XMAME

   This the the *nix port of the legendary MAME. MAME is an arcade
   machine emulator, started in 1997 by Nicola Salmoria. It started out
   as a series of emulators for individual games. This series of
   emulators was combined into a single multi-game emulator. This is the
   current form of MAME; no longer a one-man show, there are over 100
   contributors to the project.

Pending Jobs - or TODO

   If you think you can help with the todo list or you can make a
   contribution that you feel is interesting, please send mail to the
   xmame/xmess coordinator. See Mail for contact information.

     * Optimise mouse warping.
     * Remove osd_input_init_post, add display ready flag.
     * Updating of fps is off (dirty marking problem) with vector games.
     * Convert all remaining sound drivers to plugins.
     * Rewrite display/input code to be more modular, oo-ish, and usable
       as a separate library.
     * Split -[no]scanline option into emulated and real scanline
       options.
     * Add an option to specify which resolution to use, add clipping and
       panning if it doesn't fit and use it anyway.
     * Use Pentium TSC for uclock where available.
     * Network:
          + Add support for more than 2 players.
          + Explore P2P as an alternative to the existing server-based
            method.
          + Add mouse/joystick support to network play. [Is this already
            in place?]
          + Make network code more robust, version check, input settings
            check, etc.
          + Split off the OS-specific portions of the network code and
            submit the rest for inclusion in the MAME core.
     * Check X11 joystick support. Rumor has it it's broken, but then
       again there's only one bug-report, so it seems no one is using it.
     * FM soundhack for linux-i386.
     * Make which messages are emitted and when configurable (log-type's
       and log-level), make fileio emit messages about which files it
       tries to open, to help debug rom-loading problems, and walk
       through all messages xmame emits giving them all a standard format
       like:
OSD:        Info:    bla
X11-window: Warning: bla
Svgalib:    Error:   bla

     * Add scancode 128-255 for non-PC keys like F13 -- F24, more keypad
       keys, etc., update all display targets to use this.
     * Also see the text todo file, kept around to quickly enter stuff
       while hacking: todo.

Compiling, Setting Up and Starting Xmame/Xmess

   Note: This section is not a Unix tutorial. You need to know some basic
   Unix commands to compile and install xmame/xmess.
     _________________________________________________________________

Requirements

     * GNU make is MANDATORY in ALL Systems, even if you use a different
       compiler.
     * On all platforms zlib is now needed since the core uses it. If you
       don't have zlib, a stripped version is included with xmame. See:
       FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not while compiling? and FAQ: Why
       do I get zlib.h not found?
     * You are encouraged to use a GNU development environment: gcc,
       gmake, GNU ar. Lots of problems are found due to the very
       permissive syntax in gcc, so if you use a strictly ANSI C
       compiler, you'll get lots of warnings, and if the version of
       xmame/xmess is not fully debugged, compilation errors.
     * Xmame compilation breaks when using egcs-1.1.x or gcc-2.95, use
       -fno-strict-aliasing to fix it. gcc-2.95.1 does work with
       -fstrict-aliasing, and gives a nice speed increase.
     * Xmame compilation also breaks when using Red Hat 7's latest (as of
       16 January 2001) update for gcc. If you experience problems,
       please either downgrade your compiler to the one included on the
       Red Hat 7 CD-ROM, or try replacing "gcc" in the Makefile with
       "kgcc", which will invoke egcs-1.1.2. (But please see above about
       the -fstrict-aliasing flag.)
     _________________________________________________________________

Follow these steps to compile xmame/xmess

    1. See Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems for platform
       specific compiling information.
    2. See Display subsystem specific comments and notes for special
       display methods information.
    3. Download the xmame/xmess source files archive.
    4. Move the xmame/xmess source files archive to a suitable work
       directory. When you extract the archive, sub directories will be
       created under the work directory.
    5. Use bzcat and tar to decompress the archive. For example:
bzcat xmame-0.81.1.tar.bz2 | tar xv

       There are other ways to extract the archive, such as the great
       "atool" script.
    6. After extracting the archive, change to the subdirectory created
       by the extraction process. For example, after extracting the
       xmame-0.81.1.tar.bz2 archive, a directory named xmame-0.81.1 is
       created; change to it. This directory is the top of the source
       tree.
    7. Edit the Makefile (a link to makefile.unix) and change the
       settings according to your system. The default makefile.unix is
       preconfigured to run under X11/Linux. Be careful when you edit
       this file.
          + If you intend to compile in X11 joystick support, type the
            following to see the available Xdevice list:
make xlistdev; ./xlistdev

          + Choose the desired device and re-edit Makefile, setting the
            option X11_JOYNAME to the correct device.
    8. Compile xmame/xmess by typing:
make

    9. If the compile fails, report the problem to the author.
   10. *** YOU MAY NEED TO BE root TO PERFORM THIS STEP *** To install
       xmame/xmess, type:
make install

   11. If you want you can now build xmame/xmess for another
       target/display method, otherwise skip to the next step.
         a. If you want to also build for another target repeat repeat
            the "make" and "make install" steps adding "TARGET=<target>"
            to the make command for example:
make TARGET=mess
make install

         b. If you want to also build for another display method repeat
            the "make" and "make install" steps adding
            "DISPLAY_METHOD=<method>" to the make command for example:
make DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install

         c. You can also combine the 2 above for example:
make TARGET=mess DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install

   12. In your home directory, create a subdirectory called .xmame.
   13. From the top of the source tree, copy the file doc/xmamerc.dist to
       the ${HOME}/.xmame/ directory. (For xmess do this for xmessrc)
   14. If desired, copy xmamerc.dist to the global xmamerc location as
       "xmamerc" (for xmess, copy xmamerc.dist to xmessrc). The global
       xmamerc location is defined in the Makefile.
   15. Edit ${HOME}/.xmame/xmamerc to match your preferences. (For xmess,
       edit ${HOME}/.xmess/xmessrc)
   16. Be sure that the DISPLAY and PATH environment variables are set
       correctly.
   17. Make sure your ROM images are installed.
   18. Start the X-Window System. (Unless you compiled for a different
       display method in which case you skip this step.)
   19. Start xmame/xmess. For example:
/usr/local/bin/xmame.x11 dkong
     _________________________________________________________________

If you have problems compiling, installing and starting xmame/xmess...

     * Read Xmame frequently asked questions
     * Read (the recent parts of) Changelogs. They might contain some
       hints about recent changes which aren't fully documented yet.
     * Check Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems for operating
       system-specific notes. You may need to do something special for
       your operating system.
     * Check Display subsystem specific comments and notes for display
       subsystem-specific notes. You may need to do something special for
       your display system.
     * If you get an error about gz_open and a bunch of other functions
       not found during linking, read: FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol
       not while compiling? and FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?.
     * Be sure that the rompath in your xmamerc/xmessrc is correct; see
       FAQ: Where do roms.images.etc go?.
     * Check xmamerc/xmessrc: Is it configured correctly?
     * Are you getting messages that you are missing files? Maybe you are
       missing PROMs; see FAQ: Why doesn't a game work? and FAQ: What are
       PROMs?
     * Is the program in your PATH?
     * The svgalib/xf86_dga build of xmame/xmess requires setuid root.
       Are your permissions correct?
     * Try asking the friendly folks at the newsgroup alt.game.mame to
       see if anyone else has experienced the same problem as you.
     * Try mailing to the xmame mailinglist, see Mail for more
       information.

   If all else fails, send email to the current maintainer of the
   xmame/xmess project. See Mail for contact information.

Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems

Linux i386

   Linux i386 is the platform I (Hans) use, so xmame should compile
   without any hassles on Linux i386. (Note: The same is true for
   Lawrence Gold.)

   Some bugs have been found and worked around when using gcc27x, please
   use egcs if available. If more gcc bugs popup, egcs will be made
   mandatory, but I hope that won't be necessary.

   It has been reported that some SoundBlaster AWE32 and VIA-82cxxx
   (onboard) cards do not correctly manage get_freespace(). If so, you'll
   get some audio_ioctl() calls failed messages in console, and if
   everything goes right a message that xmame/xmess is falling back to
   timer based audio. If this doesn't happen and sound isn't right, try
   forcing timer-based audio by starting xmame/xmess with -timer.

   SB64/128PCI cards (Ensoniq 137x-based cards) also do not correctly
   manage get_freespace(). Unfortunately, this doesn't result in failed
   ioctl's; instead, they just ignore the calls. Xmame tries to
   autodetect this and to fall back to timer-based audio. If this doesn't
   happen and sound isn't right, try forcing timer based audio by
   starting xmame/xmess with -timer.

   Some have reported success using ALSA with OSS emulation (see
   http://www.alsa-project.org/). If you experience the above problems,
   this would certainly be worth a try.

   Also, I've tested sound using the PC-Speaker driver module. It works!!
   But it needs -timer. Again, it should do this automagically, but you
   know what to do if it doesn't.

   Distribution-Specific Comments:

     * S.u.S.E. Linux: Besides the gcc compiler and libc libraries, which
       are both from the "d" series, other packages need to be installed
       or the build will fail. If compiling for svgalib, the svgalib
       package from series "d" installed. If compiling for the X-Window
       System, you must have xdevel package from series "x" installed.
       These packages can be installed using the "yast" utility included
       in the S.u.S.E. distribution.
     * Red Hat Linux is the operating system used by the author.
       xmame/xmess should build correctly under Red Hat Linux. :-)
     _________________________________________________________________

Linux PowerPC

   Linux PowerPC should work from now on. Here's an email from Andreas
   Varga sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at, the Linux/PowerPC maintainer,
   describing the necessary steps:

   Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on Linux/PowerPC with
   SVGALIB

   Makefile:

     * enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc
     * enable DISPLAY_METHOD = svgalib
     * enable ARCH = linux
     * remove -lvgagl from LIBS.svgalib in src/unix/unix.mak (only -lvga
       is required)

   Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on Linux/PowerPC with X11

   Makefile:

     * enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc
     * enable DISPLAY_METHOD = x11
     * enable ARCH = linux

   Another thing... sound is not working, because sound drivers support
   is currently under development in Linux/PPC kernels...there is an old
   driver that is a hacked Soundblaster driver, and newer 2.1.1xx kernels
   have a sound drivers based on Amiga DMA sound drivers... Once this
   issues are settled there should be a full OSS-compatible driver...
   sound should work then...

   I can't speak about Joystick support...

   The original Linux/PPC target changes in the Makefile were done by me,
   but there are some other changes required to get it to compile...
   Starting from October I will have some more time to work on this, and
   I'll keep you updated...

   Cheers, Andreas
     _________________________________________________________________

IRIX

   Use the generic unix arch for those machines that have no sound
   support installed (xmame/xmess uses the dmedia package or the newer AL
   package on IRIX systems).

   Silicon Graphics provides several native compilers. xmame/xmess has
   been compiled and tested with the normal cc. There were some problems
   with this when using -n32 for new style 32bit code. It does work when
   using -o32 for oldstyle 32 bit code. It should now also work with -n32
   which is much faster.

   The use of DCC is not recommended (anymore) since it's a C++ compiler
   and thus won't even compile xmame/xmess out of the box due to uncasted
   mallocs. Changing all these mallocs would be crazy, esp. since they
   are not only in the osd part, but also in the core which is not under
   our control. Besides that, mame is normal C, so please compile it with
   a normal C compiler.

   Some problems have been reported using the GNU linker. It's
   recommended that you use the native one.
     _________________________________________________________________

HPUX

   Use the generic unix arch. In HP-UX, gcc and gnu-make are MANDATORY.
     _________________________________________________________________

ULTRIX

   Use the generic unix arch.

   Notes received from Danny dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es

   VERY IMPORTANT!!!

   The xmame/xmess CPU emulators access memory through pointers which are
   sometimes cast to illegal addresses - as far as the MIPS CPU is
   concerned. The Ultrix operating system is aware of that and fixes this
   "unaligned data access".

   Depending on your system setup, lots of warnings are generated for
   certain games. Fortunately these messages can be disabled by executing
   the command "uac p 0" in the same shell where xmame/xmess will be
   running.

   UPDATE: The new -DALIGN_INTS switch in the makefile fixes these
   unaligned accesses in the source which is probably a lot faster than
   hot fixing them in the kernel segfault handler.

   Use gnu make.

   Compile with the `c89' compiler. Though `gcc' has no problems with
   compiling and optimizing xmame/xmess, the resulting `c89' executable
   is faster on an empty machine (read: xmame can use all cpu & memory
   without competing with other high priority processes), so you can set
   `frameskip' to 1.

   When compiling with `c89 -O2' don't forget to also use `-Olimit 1000'.
   If 1000 is not enough, the compiler will tell you to increase it.
     _________________________________________________________________

SunOS & Solaris

   There are 2 relevant architecture options available in the makefile:
    ARCH = generic : use this for old SunOs running on Sparcs,
                     but a Sparc running Solaris will usually
                     handle this option too.
    ARCH = solaris : this is the one you should use for Sparcs
                     running Solaris.


   Currently sound is not supported under sunos. The solaris arch does
   support audio.

   If you are using Sun's OpenWindows implementation of X11, then make
   sure that the X11INC and X11LIB variables in the X11 Options section
   of the makefile are set properly. (There are already entries for the
   standard OpenWin directory there that you can uncomment.)

   Of course, if you are compiling for X11 then you need to set these
   variables properly, no matter what implementation of X11 you are
   using! :)

   If you are using Sun's SunPro cc compiler, then the following
   optimisation flags have been reported to be good:
    OPTFLAGS    = -fast -xO4 -native


   Finally, there has been a case of the xmame compilation processes
   breaking over the "ar" program. Most Solaris installations will
   include a set of utilities that conform to the XPG4 standard, usually
   in the "/usr/xpg4/bin" directory. The XPG4 version of "ar" should be
   avoided like the plague. Ensure that the "/usr/ccs/bin" appears in
   your path before the "/usr/xpg4/bin" directory and everything should
   go smoothly.

   PLEASE NOTE : There is currently not much support for SunOS/Solaris.
   If you have any trouble, try to fix it yourself. If you succeed, send
   a message to the mailing list detailing what you did. If you don't
   succeed, send a message anyway and someone _may_ be able to help you.
   Either way, this is the only way that problems with xmame on
   SunOS/Solaris will get fixed.
     _________________________________________________________________

Openstep

   You must use the OpenStep gnumake, not make. You must also use the
   NeXT/Apple cc rather than gcc. Also use only the optimisation options
   as recommended for OpenStep in the makefile, others will cause the
   resulting executable to crash. The OpenStep assembler on i386
   architectures is incompatible with the mame assembler CPU cores and
   thus you must use the C versions (Use i386-noasm instead of i386 when
   compiling for i386).

   The supplied complier is based on gcc 2.7.2.1 which will not compile
   src/profiler.c without crashing. To get around this you must turn off
   + optimisation when this crash occurs, re-make to compile this file
   only, then stop the make, re-enable optimisation, and continue.

   On an OpenStep keyboard the functions keys do not all operate as
   expected. Using the command key in conjuction with a number key
   generates the equivalent function key within xmame, with 0, - and = +
   representing F10, F11 and F12 resepectively. Also note that the ALT +
   keys cannot be mapped. As most games tend to use this as the default
   fire button it is exteremly useful to remap this globally the first
   time you run xmame.

Xmame Frequently Asked Questions

What is mame?

   MAME is an arcade machine emulator. Started in 1997 by Nicola
   Salmoria, mame started out as a series of emulators for individual
   games. This series of emulators was combined into a simgle multi-game
   emulator. This is the current form of mame; no longer a one-man show,
   there are over 100 contributors to the project.

   MAME was created by Nicola Salmoria.

   Also see the official mame readme file (readme.mame)
     _________________________________________________________________

What is mess?

   Mess is just like mame---a virtual machine emulator, only it doesn't
   emulate arcade machines but rather computers and consoles.

   Also see the official mess readme file (readme.mess)
     _________________________________________________________________

What is xmame/xmess?

   Xmame/xmess are the Unix/X11 ports of the mame and mess projects. It
   makes mame/mess available on *ix machines using the X11R6 X-Window
   System (and SVGAlib/ggi/XF86-DGA/OpenGL/SDL too).

   MAME was orginally ported by Allard Van Der Bas, Dick the Ridder, Juan
   Antonio Martinez, and Hans de Goede.

   Xmame/xmess is currently maintained by Lawrence Gold.
     _________________________________________________________________

What are the differences between mame/mess and xmame/xmess?

   None significant.

   Xmame/xmess is based on the mame/mess source code. Due to technical
   reasons beyond the scope of this document, the mame/mess source may
   not compile under Unix. That's why the xmame/xmess project exists.
   Each time mame/mess is updated, the code is tested (and patched if
   needed) under Unix. This way xmame/xmess releases are always the same
   as their mame counterparts.

   There are no plans for the independent development of xmame/xmess.
     _________________________________________________________________

What hardware and operating systems are supported?

   Xmame runs on both little-endian and big-endian CPUs, using aligned
   integer access if needed and is compatible with 64 bit CPUs. The
   current list of supported CPUs in the makefile is:

     * i386 + gnu-asm
     * i386 no asm
     * alpha
     * ia64 (merced)
     * m68k
     * generic risc (PowerPC, Sparc, HPPA, IBM)
     * generic risc, lsb-first (RISC (Ultrix machines))
     * mips (generic risc + SGI compiler bug workarounds)

   Adding support for another cpu (if necessary) should be trivial.

   The following Unix platforms are specifically supported:

     * Linux
     * FreeBSD
     * NetBSD
     * Solaris (SunOS)
     * OpenStep (noasm only on i386)
     * IRIX with sound using the dmedia package or the new al package
       (sound currently broken)
     * AIX (sound currently broken)
     * generic unix, no sound

   The generic unix entry should work for any reasonable standard Unix
   variant, but lacks sound since there is no single Unix sound standard.

   On all platforms, zlib is now needed since the core uses it. Ff you
   don't have zlib, use the included one by uncommenting the appropriate
   line in Makefile.

   The following display methods are supported. X11 is the only one which
   works on all platforms, except for OpenStep which only works with
   Openstep bitmaps:

     * X11 (X-Window System)
     * svgalib
     * GGI (Generic Graphics Interface)
     * OpenGL using X11 for input
     * glide using X11 for input (3DFX)
     * glide using svgalib for input (3DFX)
     * OpenStep bitmaps
     * SDL (Simple Direct Medialayer)

   The following is a list of arch/os/display combinations, with
   maintainers, for arch/os/display combinations which are actively
   supported. Please mail the maintainer of the arch/os/display
   combination for compilation and other arch/os/display specific
   problems. Mail Lawrence gold@aros.net for generic (e.g., X11)
   problems.

   We are always looking for people willing to test and answer questions
   about xmame on a new arch/os/display. This takes very little work and
   could help other people tremendously. If you're interested, mail
   Lawrence <gold@aros.net>.
     _________________________________________________________________

My system is supported but xmame/xmess gives me errors and fails. Why?

   Xmame/xmess should run on 16, 24 and 32bpp true color displays. If
   your X server does not support any of these display types, xmame/xmess
   will not run. Support for 8bpp pseudo color displays may return in
   future versions.

   You can verify your X server support by starting your X server and
   running the xdpyinfo program. See the xdpyinfo manual page for more
   information.
     _________________________________________________________________

What is the role of the xmamerc/xmessrc file?

   A normal xmame/xmess invocation looks like:
    xmame pacman -sound -nojoy -frameskip 2 -heightscale 3 \
        -widthscale 2


   Most of the time, you will want to use the same configuration for each
   game. xmame/xmess will read this file for default values for the
   parameters that you can set. This way the only parameters you need to
   express on the command line are the ones you want to override.

   Another reason for xmamerc/xmessrc is keyboard remapping. Some Unix
   keyboards are very different than their PC counterparts. To compensate
   for the changes, xmame/xmess allows you to remap keys that are not
   available on Unix keyboards to keys that are available.
     _________________________________________________________________

What is the syntax of the xmamerc/xmessrc file.

   The syntax is quite simple:
   "keyword value"


   See xmamerc.dist for most keywords. Allmost all commandline options
   can be used as keywords (without the -), use value 0 or 1 for
   commandline options which have a negating (-no[option]) counterpart.
   As usual lines begining with "#" are comments.

   You can also generate a configfile with all the current settings to
   use as a template by typing:
   xmame -showconfig > ~/.xmame/xmamerc

     _________________________________________________________________

Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc go?

Roms/Samples

   Xmame/xmess uses a ":" seperated rompath to find out which dirs to
   search for roms/samples.

   The default rompath is XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile during
   compile.

   This is overwritten by any rompath in xmamerc/xmessrc, which can be
   overwritten again with the -rompath commandline option.

   Xmame/xmess searches every dir in this path for roms/samples in the
   following way:
    <dir>/gamename.zip             (containing filename.ext)
    <dir>/gamename/filename.ext
    <dir>/gamename/filename.ext.gz (containing filename.ext)
    <dir>/gamename/filename.zip    (containing filename.ext)


   So let's say that we are searching for rom0001.1, which is part of
   pacman. Then xmame/xmess would search every dir in your rompath for
    <dir>/pacman.zip               (containing rom0001.1)
    <dir>/pacman/rom0001.1
    <dir>/pacman/rom0001.1.gz      (containing rom0001.1)
    <dir>/pacman/rom0001.zip       (containing rom0001.1)


   Note: If your neogeo games can't find neogeo.rom, put it in a dir
   called neogeo somewhere in your rompath, or put it in neogeo.zip
   somewhere in your rompath.
     _________________________________________________________________

Read/write Diskette Images

   This section only applies to xmess emulations which support read/write
   diskette images and thus try to open the image read/write.

   Xmess first searches for read/write images with the name specified on
   the commandline:
    <path>/image.ext


   where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline.
   This way, absolute and relative filenames can be used directly on the
   commandline for an image which is not in the rompath.

   Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for roms/samples in the
   following way:
    <dir>/image.ext


   Note that (g)zipped images are not supported for r/w images.
     _________________________________________________________________

Rom Cartridges/Read Only Diskette Images

   Xmess begins by searching for cartdriges/disks from the current dir in
   the following way:
    <path>/image.ext
    <path>/image.ext.gz            (containing image.ext)
    <path>/image.zip               (containing image.ext)


   where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline.
   This way, absolute and relative filenames can be used directly on the
   commandline for an image which is not in the rompath.

   Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for carts/images in the
   following way:
    <dir>/image.ext
    <dir>/image.ext.gz             (containing image.ext)
    <dir>/image.zip                (containing image.ext)


   Finally, xmess searches the rompath as desribed above using the
   systemtype for gamename.

   So let's say we want to play mario.nes on the nes emulation of xmess.
   We would then type: "xmess nes mario.nes". Xmess then begins by
   searching the current dir for
    mario.nes
    mario.nes.gz                   (containing mario.nes)
    mario.zip                      (containing mario.nes)


   After that, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
    <dir>/mario.nes
    <dir>/mario.nes.gz             (containing mario.nes)
    <dir>/mario.zip                (containing mario.nes)


   And finally, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
    <dir>/nes.zip                  (containing mario.nes)
    <dir>/nes/mario.nes
    <dir>/nes/mario.nes.gz         (containing mario.nes)
    <dir>/nes/mario.zip            (containing mario.nes)


   Since xmess first searches for cartridges/disks from the current dir
   you can also specify cartridges/disks not in your rompath. For
   example:
    "xmess nes ../mario.nes"


   Xmess then searches for
    ../mario.nes
    ../mario.nes.gz                (containing mario.nes)
    ../mario.zip                   (containing mario.nes)


   and will also search the rompath as described above with ../mario.nes
   as the image name but this is not that useful.
     _________________________________________________________________

Artwork

   Xmame/xmess searches every dir in the rompath for artwork in the
   following way:
    <dir>/artwork.png
    <dir>/artwork.png.gz           (containing artwork.png)
    <dir>/artwork.zip              (containing artwork.png)


   Then xmame/xmess searches the rompath as in roms/samples.

   So let's say we want to play foo which uses bar.png. Xmame/xmess then
   begins searching each dir in your rompath for
    <dir>/bar.png
    <dir>/bar.png.gz               (containing bar.png)
    <dir>/bar.zip                  (containing bar.png)


   And then xmame/xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
    <dir>/foo.zip                  (containing bar.png)
    <dir>/foo/bar.png
    <dir>/foo/bar.png.gz           (containing bar.png)
    <dir>/foo/bar.zip              (containing bar.png)

     _________________________________________________________________

Xmame configuration

   Xmame looks for the following configuration files and parses each one
   found. Files parsed later can overwrite options in previously parsed
   files:
    XMAMEROOT/xmamerc
    XMAMEROOT/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/xmamerc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/rc/<gamename>rc


   XMAMEROOT is defined during compile time, see Makefile.

   DISPLAY_METHOD is the DISPLAY_METHOD for which xmame was compiled,
   this can be one of: x11, svgalib, ggi, xgl, xfx, svgafx, openstep,
   SDL.

   For xmess of course replace xmame by xmess. ;)
     _________________________________________________________________

Game configuration

   Game configuration files are kept on a per-user base in:
    ${HOME}/.xmame/cfg/<game>.cfg resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/cfg/<game>.cfg

     _________________________________________________________________

Game state

   Game state files are kept on a per-user base in:
    ${HOME}/.xmame/sta/<game>.sta resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/sta/<game>.sta

     _________________________________________________________________

NVram

   NVram files are kept on a per-user base in:
    ${HOME}/.xmame/nvram/<game>.nv resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/nvram/<game>.nv

     _________________________________________________________________

Mem cards

   Mem cards files are kept on a per-user base in:
    ${HOME}/.xmame/mem/<filename>.mem resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/mem/<filename>.mem


   Where <filename> is given by the game-driver.
     _________________________________________________________________

Screenshots

   Screenshots, which can be made by pressing F12, are saved as png files
   in the directory from where xmame is started (cwd).

   This can be overidden by the screenshotdir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc,
   which can again be overidden by the -screenshotdir cmdline-option.

   They are saved as:
    <screenshotdir>/<game>xxxx.png
    Where xxxx is a number.

     _________________________________________________________________

Highscores

   Highscores are stored in XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile when
   building. This can be overidden by the spooldir entry in
   xmamerc/xmessrc, which can again be overidden by the -spooldir
   cmdline-option.

   So only give a
    drwxrwsr-x root games <spooldir>


   permission and setgid xmame/xmess to "games" to get it to work. Note
   this doesn't work with suid root versions (svgalib & XF86-DGA),
   suggestions welcome.

   For now use ${HOME}/.xmame or $ {HOME}/.xmess as the spooldir in
   xmamerc/xmessrc for suid root versions.

   Note: For highscores to work, xmame must also be able to find
   hiscore.dat.
     _________________________________________________________________

hiscore.dat

   If you want to use highscores mame needs to load hiscore.dat to get
   highscore info.

   The default is XMAMEROOT/hiscore.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
   compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the
   hiscorefile entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden
   by the cmdline-option -hiscorefile.

   hiscore.dat is available from the mame homepage: http://www.mame.net
     _________________________________________________________________

cheat.dat

   If you want to use cheats mame needs to load cheat.dat to get cheat
   info.

   The default is XMAMEROOT/cheat.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
   compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the
   cheatfile entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden
   by the cmdline-option -cheatfile.

   cheat.dat is available from the mame homepage: http://www.mame.net
     _________________________________________________________________

history.dat

   If you want to display some nice background info on games, mame needs
   to load history.dat.

   The default is XMAMEROOT/history.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
   compile-time, see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the
   historyfile entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden
   by the cmdline-option -historyfile.

   history.dat is available from the mame homepage: http://www.mame.net
     _________________________________________________________________

Input logs

   Input logs are saved/read under the name specified after the -record /
   -playback option; this name is relative to the current path.
     _________________________________________________________________

Xmame/xmess still can't find files/store highscores

   Type "xmame/xmess -showconfig | more" and check that the rompath and
   spooldir shown are correct and readable/writable. Otherwise recheck
   xmamerc/xmessrc. Remember that xmess also searches the current dir.
     _________________________________________________________________

How do I start xmess/xmame ?

   To start xmame, type
    xmame [options] <gamename> [more options]


   For xmess, type
    xmess [options] <systemname> [more options] \
    <disk/romimage(s)> [more options]


   All options are optional. ;)

   Xmame/xmess supports most dos command line options (see readme.mame /
   readme.mess) as well as a few of its own: Type xmame -help | more for
   a complete list.

   With xmess, some systems don't require a disk/romimage, but most do.
     _________________________________________________________________

What are the command line parameters for xmame/xmess?

   To see a list of available parameters, type:
    /usr/games/xmame -help | more


   Xmame/xmess supports most of the command line parameters as the DOS
   version as well a some of its own.

   See the file readme.mame / readme.mess for more information about the
   command line parameters.
     _________________________________________________________________

What keys does xmame/xmess use?

   Xmame/xmess uses the same key-bindings as the DOS version of mame: The
   following keys work in all emulators:
    `  or ~      Enter On screen display to change volume, brightness etc.
    Tab          Enter configuration menu. Press Tab or Esc to get back to
                 the emulation.
    P            Pause
    F3           Reset
    F4           Show the game graphics. Use cursor keys to change set/color,
                 F4 or Esc to return to the emulation.
    F8           Reduce frame skip
    F9           Increase frameskip
    F10          Toggle speed throttling
    F10 + shift  Toggle idle sleeping
    F11          Toggle speed display
    F11 + shift  Toggle profiler display
    F12          Save a screen snapshot
    ESC          Exit emulator


   Xmame has 2 different auto frameskipping algorithms. These can be
   selected with the -frameskipper option and with key combos:
    Key combo:             Gives you the:
    left-ctrl + insert     standard dos frameskipper
    left-ctrl + home       William Barath's frameskipper


   Xmame's display scaling can be controlled on the fly with the
   following key combos:
    Key combo:             Result:
    left-shift + insert    Increase widthscale
    left-shift + delete    Decrease widthscale
    left-shift + home      Increase heightscale
    left-shift + end       Decrease heightscale
    left-shift + pageup    Increase scale
    left-shift + pagedown  Decrease scale


   Under X11, xmame can switch to and from different modes during
   runtime:
    Key combo:             Warps you to:
    left-alt + insert      Normal window
    left-alt + home        DGA fullscreen mode


   Under SDL, xmame can switch to and from different modes during
   runtime:
    Key combo:             Result:
    left-alt + enter       Toggles between windowed and
                           fullscreen modes.


   Under X11 in a window, you can also grab the mouse. To be able to play
   with the mouse, press left-alt + page-down to grab the mouse, and
   press it again to release it.
     _________________________________________________________________

Why doesn't a game have sound?

     * First check that sound is working in other applications.
     * Check that sound is supported for the game that has no sound; not
       all games have sound.
     * For xmame, take a look at gamelist.mame: Is the sound for the game
       emulated?
     * For xmess take a look at readme.mess: Is the sound for the system
       emulated?
     * Check the operating system support chart in the earlier part of
       this file: Does xmame/xmess support sound on your system?
     _________________________________________________________________

My sound seems lagged. / My sound Clicks. / What does -bufsize do?

   With the -bufsize commandline option or the bufsize configfile
   keyword, you can specify the number of frames of audio to buffer. The
   default is 2 frames.

   This value should be ok for everyone, but if you still have problems,
   read on.

   If the buffersize is to small, this causes the buffer to get empty
   between frames which in turn causes clicks/pauses in the sound. If
   this is the case, increasing the -bufsize value to, for example, 2.5
   should help.

   If, however, you make the buffersize too large, then so much audio
   becomes buffered, that the sound could become lagged. E.g., you would
   hear the coin drop sound 0.5 seconds after pressing the insert coin
   key. In this case, lower the bufsize to, for example, 1.5.

   Please let me know if you need to change this setting, since I'm
   planning on removing it in a future release.
     _________________________________________________________________

Why doesn't a game work?

     * Do you have the right roms or did you get checksum failures?
     * Xmame version 0.34 and higher require PROM files that were not
       included in ROM images released before version 0.34. See the
       question on PROMs below for more information.
     * For xmame, check the file gamelist.mame to see if the game is
       playable. Just because a game is included doesn't mean it is
       working yet.
     * For xmess, take a look at readme.mess. Maybe the system isn't
       emulated all that well yet.
     * Some games require sound support. If you don't have sound support
       under your Unix installation or sound isn't supported by
       xmame/xmess for you, try the -fakesound command line parameter.
     _________________________________________________________________

What are PROMs?

   PROMs contain game-specific information that used to be built in to
   mame in versions prior to 0.34. This information has been extracted
   and is now included with new versions of ROM files for games that
   require this information.

   If you want to use your current ROM files, you can obtain just the
   PROM images in one large file at:

   http://mame.retrogames.com/
     _________________________________________________________________

Why is xmame/xmess slow?

   Xmame/xmess is a compiled C program that is emulating hardware.
   Software emulation of hardware always incurs a speed penalty. Here are
   some things you can do:

     * Try using the -frameskip command line parameter.
     * Try pressing F8 while running xmame/xmess to alter the frame rate.
     * Try disabling the throttle with the -nothrottle command line
       parameter or by pressing F10 while running xmame/xmess.
     * While running xmame/xmess, press F11 to check the speed of
       xmame/xmess. If you never get a display of 100%, you need a faster
       computer.

   You can also try recompiling xmame/xmess with more optimal settings.
   The following suggestions may not work or may not be appropriate on
   some machines and in some installations. However, in cases where they
   do work, there can be a noticeable increase in overall performance of
   xmame/xmess.

   These "enhancements" simply require editing the Makefile that is
   distributed with xmame, and then recompiling the source. If you are
   compiling the source for the second time you will need to do:
    make clean
    make
    make install


   after editing the Makefile to set your new settings.
     _________________________________________________________________

SPEEDUP # 1 - Inline compiling

   Try enabling inline compiling by commenting and uncommenting the
   following lines:
    # IL    = '-DINLINE=static inline'
    IL     = -DINLINE=static

     _________________________________________________________________

SPEEDUP # 2 - Direct Graphics Access

   For a big boost, try enabling DGA by uncommenting the following line:
    DGA = 1


   Then start xmame as root, and press left-alt + home to switch to dga
   mode; that should be a lot faster, and doesn't need/use xsync. ;)

   To get back to a window without exiting, press left-alt + insert.

   The benefit of DGA is that it is Direct Graphics Access and therefore
   writes directly to the framebuffer (think DirectX versus GDI under MS
   Windows). So it should be a tad faster, unless you've got a really
   really well accelerated X server, which could be just as fast. Try
   pressing F11 to see the actual framerate, although it might be hardly
   noticable (visually, at least), it should give you some speed
   increase.

   Besides that, it automatically switches to the right mode and removes
   any window manager stuff, but that can be done without DGA too. (I
   might add such a feature later, since it allows easy fullscreen
   without running as root.)

   Adding a 320x240 mode will most definitely get you a very nice
   fullscreen display at scale = 1. ;)

   Don't forget that you still need to set up the Modes line of the
   "Display" subsection of the "Screen" section in your X11 config file
   if you want the games to fill the screen in DGA mode. Xmame will pick
   the best mode it can find, so if you have a line like
    Modes  "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "320x240" "256x224"


   then any game which fits into a 320x240 screen can be displayed in
   that resolution, and so on. Don't forget your X11 config file might
   have a number of different "Screen" sections in it, and you will need
   to add Modes to the one that is actually active with your Xserver is
   running. And of course it's not always that easy, since you also need
   to tell X which monitor settings are required for these resolution
   modes. This is done through Modeline entries in the "Monitor" section
   of your X config file.

   You can check out the /contrib/tools/modelines file for a set of crazy
   modes made especially for xmame in DGA mode. They should work on any
   reasonable multisync monitor, but don't use them on an old
   fixed-frequency monitor. (And if you can't resist trying, I won't pay
   for a new one!)
     _________________________________________________________________

SPEEDUP # 3 - NASM

   You can also try installing nasm and compiling the asm core, that
   helps a bit too.
     _________________________________________________________________

SPEEDUP # 4 - ICC

   If you are running on an intel architecture machine, you could try to
   compile xmame with the Intel C Compiler. Some people have reported
   speed gains from +10%.
     _________________________________________________________________

I've got a dual processor machine. What can I do to take full advantage of
this?

   Not much. Xmame is a single-threaded port of a single-threaded DOS
   app. Some degree of speedup will hopefully be found on an SMP machine
   since xmame is more likely to get to hog its one CPU for longer. But
   of course the same applies to any CPU-intensive program. And all the
   things one would normally do to any application to give it more CPU
   time (higher priority, kill or renice unecessary process, etc.) will
   work with xmame.

   Now you may at this point be thinking, "Surely you could have one
   thread doing emulation and another thead doing graphics to get a
   speedup." Yes, but there are some serious issues to consider. The
   first is synchronisation between the threads, which needs to be pretty
   tight. If not done smoothly. the overhead will blow most of the
   benefit away. Also, it needs to be implemented with a portable threads
   interface ... which basically means POSIX threads. In a nutshell, it's
   a lot of effort for probably not much gain. But of course if you are
   feeling particulary energetic and in the mood to code, then patches
   can always be submitted to the xmame devel mailing list ... :)
     _________________________________________________________________

Why doesn't my joystick handle diagonal movement correctly on my Intel x86
system?

   Xmame/xmess uses autocalibrating, but you could try to use specific
   programs to calibrate it (jscal that comes with joystick module works
   fine....).
     _________________________________________________________________

How do I enable XinputExtensions X11 based joystick in Xfree86?

   You need to edit XF86Config to enable the XInput section. See the
   manual page for XF86Config.
     _________________________________________________________________

How do I read a manual page?

   Easy. If you want to read the manual page for XF86Config, type: man
   XF86Config
     _________________________________________________________________

Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?

   Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some compression
   routines. Unfortunately, a lot of Linux distributions have an old
   version of zlib installed as /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a, and the new
   version installed as /usr/lib/libz.a. If this is the case, it's
   harmless to remove /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a. If you're not sure whether
   this is the case, just move /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a to another location.

   Removing or just moving /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a should fix this problem.

   Also see: FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?
     _________________________________________________________________

Why do I get zlib.h not found?

   Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some compression
   routines.

   Zlib is standard on most Unix versions. For those who don't ship with
   zlib or ship with a version that is too old, xmame/xmess now comes
   with a stripped-down version of zlib. Uncomment the appropriate line
   in the Makefile to use this.

When I run xmame.x11, nothing happens---no window pops up or anything. Help!

   Are you running a recent version of KDE, such as 2.1.1? It appears
   that there's a bug with KDE's window manager that prevents some X11
   apps from popping up their main window. You can either run the SDL
   version of xmame, or try the following workaround, which several
   people have reported as being successful:
xmame.x11 -rid `xwininfo -root | grep xwininfo: | awk '{print $4}'`

     _________________________________________________________________

Can I run xmame fullscreen?

   Yes, of course you can. There are several ways to accomplish this,
   each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

   To enable the fullscreen support, you will need to change some
   settings in the makefile and recompile xmame.

   Besides the x11 and SDL drivers, the FX and GL drivers are also
   capable of playing games full screen. There is a separate chapter for
   these later on.
     _________________________________________________________________

xmame.x11/DGA

   First, before recompiling, make sure you have an xserver with the
   "xfree-dga" extension enabled (do a "xdpyinfo" and see if you've got
   the "xfree-dga" extension); any recent release of XFree86 should have
   it.

   Select DISPLAY_METHOD = x11 and uncomment the line "DGA=1" in the
   makefile.

   Now build xmame and give the xmame.x11 file permanent root permissions
   so that you don't need to start xmame as root (do a "chown root
   xmame.x11" and a "chmod u+s xmame.x11").

   If you want to start immediately in fullscreen mode, start xmame.x11
   with the "-x11 1" argument or specify "x11-mode 1" in your xmamerc
   file.

   During play you can switch between windowed and fullscreen mode. See
   What keys does xmame/xmess use?
     _________________________________________________________________

xmame.x11/Xv

   Xv is the X Window System video extension. Among other things, it
   supports hardware scaling if your graphics card (and X driver) is
   capable of doing so. You can achieve a very nice fullscreen display
   without taxing your cpu very much because the scaling will all be done
   by your video card.

   To determine if your video card supports the Xv extension, you may use
   this command:
xvinfo


   If you don't see a message indicating "no screens found", then the Xv
   extension is supported by your machine.

   To compile this into xmame, select DISPLAY_METHOD = x11 and uncomment
   the line "X11_XV = 1" in the makefile.

   Build xmame, and use the -fullscreen parameter when loading a game to
   get a nice fullscreen display.

   If the colors seem messed up and/or you only see half of the game
   image, try using "-yuv" or "-yv12". By default, the Xv extension
   attempts to use RGB mode if your driver supports it, but some cards'
   drivers are broken.

   If your screen goes blank or gets full of little green vertical lines,
   then your graphics card does not support the Xv extension and you're
   out of luck.
     _________________________________________________________________

xmame.SDL

   The SDL library was meant to make it easy for programmers to make full
   screen applications. To start SDL in fullscreen mode, just run
   xmame.SDL with the option '-fullscreen'. If you want to know the
   resolutions that SDL can use, run "xmame.SDL -listmodes", choose the
   resolution you want, and start "xmame.SDL -modenumber <insert chosen
   number here>".

   You can add "fullscreen 1" to your xmamerc file if you want SDL to
   start fullscreen automatically; the modenumber line can also be used
   in the xmamerc. :-)

   Most problems experienced by people who are trying to use SDL for
   fullscreen are related to the section fullscreen has a large border

   During play you can switch between windowed and fullscreen mode. See
   What keys does xmame/xmess use?
     _________________________________________________________________

xmame.SDL / fullscreen has a large border around the game.

   If the game runs in fullscreen but occupies only a small area in the
   center of the screen, then your xserver does not have access to low
   resolutions (320x240, 400x300, and 512x384, for instance). In the case
   of SDL, the window will be in the resolution of closest matching
   resolution that SDL can switch to for full screen display.

   In this case, you have to add "Modelines" for these resolutions in
   your XF86config file and add these resolutions to the resolutions list
   of your display somewhere in your XF86config file (you know, the list
   of resolutions you can switch to using ctrl-+).

   You should find modelines that works with most graphic cards in the
   xmame contrib subdirectory.

   If you don't want to alter your XF86config file, another solution is
   to run xmame.x11 with the "-scale 2" argument. In this case, the
   emulator will use 640x480 instead of 320x240, 800x600 instead of
   400x300, etc. But I don't recommend it. The scaling uses cpu and the
   games will run more slowly.

   However, if your cpu is fast enough, a better option is to use the
   effects, e.g., "-ef 1". This introduces advanced render methods to
   create a nicer looking effect than the simple scaling. On the website
   you can see screenshots of the different effects.
     _________________________________________________________________

I only use some of the emulation parts (Neo Geo / CPS-2 /...). Do I need the
entire xmame?

   There used to be targets such as "cpmame" and "neomame", but these
   have been removed from the core.
     _________________________________________________________________

Why does xmame freeze and lock up when I hit <ESC> to exit the game or P to
pause the game?

   There appears to be a bug in the "timer-based audio" code that
   xmame/oss uses on at least one motherboard that we are aware of.
   Specifically, the ATX 845Pro (Intel Pentium 4 processor) with an
   integrated i810 soundchip.

   To get around this bug use EsounD (Enlightened Sound Daemon), found as
   esd with Gnome distributions, instead of the oss sound drivers.

   Compile ESOUND support into the xmame executable by uncommenting the
   appropriate line in makefile.unix. Tell xmame to use esound by
   specifying "esound" on the "dsp-plugin" line in xmamerc, or use the
   -dp command line parameter to select esound. Also see the next section
   below.
     _________________________________________________________________

Why does xmame report "can't resolve host name '/dev/dsp'" when trying to
use esound?

   Remove the words "/dev/dsp" from the "audiodevice" line in xmamerc. In
   other words, you want to have the word "audiodevice" on a line all by
   itself, with no audiodevice specified.
     _________________________________________________________________

Where can I get the latest version of xmame/xmess?

   The xmame/xmess Home Page always has the most up-to-date version. The
   address is

   http://x.mame.net/
     _________________________________________________________________

I upgraded xmame and now some games do not work anymore.

   This can happen, especially if the drivers are in full development or
   some internal core routines have changed and the drivers have to be
   updated to accomodate for these core changes. Sometimes a new romdump
   has been made from the game and you still have the old version, or the
   zipfile has changed names and you need to rename yours (or any
   combination of these factors :-).

   Here are some things you can do:

    1. Clear all the old configuration files, nvram files, etc. Also
       delete the content of the directories mem, nvram, cfg, and try to
       run the game again. Don't forget to delete the default.cfg file!
    2. If that fails, check to see if the name of the zipfile is still in
       the list of supported games. If you enter an invalid game name,
       xmame will take a guess to determine which game you wanted; look
       at the first lines of output to see if it tries to load a
       different game than the one you want. To know if your game is
       still supported, try 'xmame.x11 -list gamename'. If you do not
       pass a game name, the complete list of supported games is printed,
       and you can search for the new game name (better use 'xmame.x11
       -listfull').
    3. If the name hasn't changed, check to see if you have the correct
       romdump. Run 'xmame.x11 -verifyroms gamename' to check your
       romset. If this fails you will need to download a newer romdump.
       Also check your parent roms as a possible cause of this romset
       failure.
    4. Read the documentation!! Or like the experts would say, "RTFM!"
       :-) Chances are that if the driver is broken, the developer has
       noted this in the documentation.
    5. If the above steps don't solve the problem, then check to see if
       it is a known problem; if necessary, report it to the mame testers
       project.

   If none of these fixes the problem, then try using the older version
   of xmame you have backed up somewhere to play the game. (You did
   back-up, didn't you?)
     _________________________________________________________________

Where can I send fixes, bug reports, suggestions, or money? :-)

   See Mail of this document.
     _________________________________________________________________

What if my question is still not answered?

   Please check the offical mame and mess readme files to see if that
   answers your question:

     * The official mame readme file (readme.mame)
     * The official mess readme file (readme.mess)

   If that doesn't help, then ask your question on the mailing list or
   send it to the xmame/xmess maintainer, see Mail for contact
   information.

Display Subsystem-Specific Comments and Notes

FXmame, a glide driver for xmame

   The latest version of this driver can be obtained at
   http://glmame.linuxgames.com.
     _________________________________________________________________

Requirements

   To run FXmame, you must have:

     * A 3Dfx card
     * Glide 2x
     * The xmame distribution
     _________________________________________________________________

Compiling and Installing

   FXmame comes in two flavours---xfx and svgafx. The xfx version is
   designed to run under X11. It uses an X window for input. The svgafx
   version runs from the console, and uses svgalib for input. Both use
   the 3Dfx hardware for rendering.

   To install FXmame, follow the general instructions for installing
   xmame. To specify the glide driver, do the following to the Makefile:

     * Select either "xfx" or "svgafx" as your display method
     * Configure the glide variables to correspond to your glide setup

   The FXmame executables are called "xmame.xfx" and "xmame.svgafx"
     _________________________________________________________________

Running

   FXmame runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard
   commands that xmame.x11 does.

   A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the glide driver:

     * RIGHTCTRL-A -- toggle antialiasing in vector games
     * RIGHTCTRL-B -- toggle bilinear filtering

   The glide driver also adds several command-line options:
    -fxgama <value> 3Dfx gamma correction value


   Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display in
   vector games, I have to overlay the game bitmap over the vector
   display. This is because I circumvent the bitmap entirely in vector
   games. Drawing the bitmap is a big cpu hog, so you'll notice that the
   game slows down when you turn on the fps display (I know, not ideal
   when you want to find out the frame rate...).
     _________________________________________________________________

Common Questions (FAQ)

   Q: When I run FXmame, it just dumps core.

   A: Make sure you are running FXmame as root. Root privileges are
   required to access the 3Dfx hardware

   Q: When I run xmame.xfx, it just hangs at the initial game screen.

   A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard input
   under KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers or use
   xmame.svgafx instead.
     _________________________________________________________________

Present Limitations/Bugs

     * Antialiasing isn't working quite as well as it should
     * Input problems under KDE
     _________________________________________________________________

Future Work

     * Optimize the drawing code to update only the changed portions of
       the game bitmap.

Version History

   v0.5 -- December 11th, 1998 ---------------------------

     * implemented long copies in screen update
     * added dirty handling. this greatly increases the speed of games
       that support the dirty update strategy (although most of them are
       older games that already ran at full speed on modern hardware)
     * merged source with xmame b8.1

   v0.4 -- October 30th, 1998 --------------------------

     * improved alpha handling in vector games - now bitmapped overlays
       do not dim the screen o added svgalib support (xmame.svgafx) o
       fixed a tiling bug that gave artifacts on texture tile boundaries

   v0.3 -- October 29th, 1998 --------------------------

     * got rid of extra lines in vector games o added bitmap overlay in
       vector games to show options/fps o added antialiasing in vector
       games

   v0.2 -- October 28th, 1998 --------------------------

     * added screenshots o added 3Dfx gamma adjustment o added direct
       acceleration of vector games (still buggy)

   v0.1 -- October 27th, 1998 --------------------------

     * first public release

GLmame, an OpenGL driver for xmame

   The latest version of this driver can be obtained at:
   http://www.jausoft.com/glmame.html
     _________________________________________________________________

Requirements

   To run GLmame you must have:

     * An OpenGL implementation
     * libjpeg
     * hardware 3D acceleration (if you want any kind of framerate)
     * the xmame distribution
     _________________________________________________________________

Compiling and Installing

   Follow the general instructions for installing xmame. To specify the
   OpenGL driver, do the following in the Makefile:

     * Select "xgl" as your display method.
     * For runtime printed debug info, add "-DGLDEBUG" to the "GLCFLAGS"
       variable.
     * GLU version 1.2 is recommended (e.g., from SGI). If you use Mesa's
       GLU, you may have to add "-DGLU_VERSION_1_2" to the "GLCFLAGS".

   The GLmame executable is called "xmame.xgl".
     _________________________________________________________________

Running

   xmame.xgl runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard
   commands that xmame.x11 does.

   The program starts up in cabinet mode. While this is pretty, and cool,
   you'll probably want to actually play in fullscreen mode.

   A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the OpenGL driver:

     * RIGHT_ALT-A -- toggle antialias filtering (vector)
     * RIGHT_ALT-B -- toggle bilinear filtering (raster)
     * RIGHT_ALT-C -- toggle cabinet/fullscreen display (both)
     * RIGHT_ALT-F -- toggle between fullscreen (max window size) and
       startup window size (both)
     * RIGHT_ALT-O -- toggle draw-bitmap (both; nonsense for raster
       games, speedup for vector games)
     * RIGHT_ALT-T -- toggle phosphor trails (vector)
     * RIGHT_ALT-PLUS_PAD -- incr. beam size (vector)
     * RIGHT_ALT-MINUS_PAD -- decr. beam size (vector)

   The OpenGL driver also adds several command-line options:
    -[no]fullscreen         Start in fullscreen mode
                            (default: disabled)
    -[no]gldblbuffer        Disable/enable double buffering
                            (default: enabled)
    -gltexture_size <int>   Force the max width and height of one
                            texture segment (default: autosize)
    -[no]glforceblitmode /  Force blitter for true color modes 15/32bpp
    -[no]glblit             (default: enabled)
    -[no]glext78 /          Force the usage of GL extension number 78,
    -[no]glext              if available (palletted texture)
                            (default: enabled)
    -[no]glbilinear /       Disable/enable bilinear filtering
    -[no]glbilin            (default: enabled)
    -[no]gldrawbitmap /     Disable/enable drawing the bitmap; e.g.,
    -[no]glbitmap           disable within vector games for a speedup
                            (default: enabled)
    -[no]glcolormod         Disable/enable color modulation (intensity,
    -[no]glcmod             gamma)
                            (default: enabled)
    -glbeam <float>         Set the beam size for vector games
                            (default: 1.0)
    -[no]glalphablending /  Disable/enable alpha blending if available
    -[no]glalpha            (default: enabled)
    -[no]glantialias /      Disable/enable antialiasing
    -[no]glaa               (default: enabled)
    -gllibname /            Choose the dynamically loaded OpenGL
    -gllib <string>         library
                            (default: libGL.so)
    -glulibname /           Choose the dynamically loaded GLU library
    -glulib <string>        (default: libGLU.so)
    -[no]cabview            Don't start/start in cabinet view mode
                            (default: don't start in this mode)
    -cabinet <cabname>      Specify which cabinet model to use
                            (default: glmamejau)

   -glres <string>          Always scale games to <Xres>x<Yres>,
                            keeping their aspect ratio.
                            This overrides the scale options.
                            Use this e.g. for the Vodoo1 gfx cards
                            with: "-glres 640x480"


   Three cabinet models are provided. The default, "glmamejau", is
   designed to look like a standard arcade cabinet, like "glmame". The
   last one, "trans", is a box with a transparent game screen.

   Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display in
   vector games, the game's bitmap is overlaid above the vector display.
   Drawing the bitmap is a big cpu hog for some low-end hardware
   accelerated OpenGL implementations, so you'll notice that the game
   slows down when the bitmap is overlaid.

   Because bitmap overlaying is the default, you can toggle it on and off
   by pressing the "RIGHT_ALT-O" key, or turn it off at startup by using
   the command line option "-noglbitmap".

   A problem with vector games and the cabinet mode is that some vector
   points do not reside within the screen coordinates, so you may see
   some vectors outside of the cabinet's mame display.

   *** IMPORTANT! ***

   If you have trouble with GLmame, or it is slow, read the "Common
   Questions" section. Most of the questions people email me are answered
   here.
     _________________________________________________________________

Cabinet Models

   Cabinet model information is stored in the "cab" subdirectory of the
   directory you specified with the ROMPATH variable in the Makefile.
   Path information specified in xmamerc or with the 'rompath' shell
   environment variable is currently not used. Each cabinet model has
   it's own subdirectory. GLmame will first try to load either the
   user-specified cabinet model (using the -cabinet command-line option),
   or a model corresponding to the current game name. Failing that, it
   will use the generic "glmame" model.

   A cabinet model directory must contain a geometry file
   <modelname>.cab, and any .jpg files used for textures on the model.
   The format of the .cab file will be familiar if you have ever
   programmed using OpenGL -- it looks much like an OpenGL display list.
   The format is as follows:
    cabv1.1


   This header must be the first 7 characters of the file.
    #<text>


   Comment lines begin with '#'
    begin <type>


   Begins a geometry object, where type is one of (points, polygon,
   quads, quad_strip, screen). Each "begin" must be paired with an "end"
   statement. A "polygon" is specified using one vertex per, well...
   vertex. "quads" are four-sided polygons, each specified by four
   vertices in order around the polygon. A "quad_strip" is a series of
   four-sided polygons, each of which shares an edge with the polygons
   before and after it in the strip. A "screen" is a quad that defines
   the actual area in 3D space where the game will be displayed. only one
   of these should be defined. For more info, look at any description of
   OpenGL geometry.
    end


   Ends the geometry object begun with "begin".
    pointsize <s>


   Changes the current pointsize to the corresponding size value
   (specified as a floating point number between 0.0 and, e.g., 20.0).
   Note: You cannot use this statement between begin and end!
    color4 <r> <g> <b>


   Changes the current color to the corresponding rgb value (specified as
   floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
    color4 <r> <g> <b> <a>


   Changes the current color to the corresponding rgba value (specified
   as floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
    shading <type>


   Sets the shading type. available types are "smooth" (which blends
   colors from one vertex to the next) or "flat" (which doesn't).
    vertex <x> <y> <z>


   Specifies a vertex for the current geometry object as a point in
   3-space.
    numtex <num>


   Specifies the number of different textures to be loaded. This
   declaration must precede any "loadtex" call.
    loadtex <num> <width> <height> <filename>


   Loads texture number <num> from .jpg file <filename>. The .jpg file
   *must* be <width> by <height> pixels, and both <width> and <height>
   must be powers of two (and must conform to the hardware requirements
   of any 3D card you want the cabinet to work with -- 256x256 for 3Dfx).
    texcoord <xcoord> <ycoord>


   Sets the texture coordinate of the next vertex. This specifies where
   in 2D texture space the vertex lies.
    enable texture


   Enables texture mapping (using the currently-selected texture).
    disable texture


   Turns off texture mapping.
    settex <num>


   Select texture <num> for doing texturing. The texture must previously
   have been loaded using "loadtex".
    camerapan <num>


   Starts the camera pan definition that will be followed by <num> camera
   transistions. After the last transision definition, the pan sequence
   must be ended with an "end" statement.
    goto <lx> <ly> <lz> <px> <py> <pz> <nx> <ny> <nz>


   Relocates and reorients the camera. The arguments are the same as are
   used by the OpenGL command "gluLookAt()". The camera is positioned at
   point <lx,ly,lz>, pointing along vector <px,py,pz>, with "up" normal
   (the direction that is "up" for the camera) <nx,ny,nz>.
    moveto <lx> <ly> <lz> <px> <py> <pz> <nx> <ny> <nz> <frames>


   Moves the camera to a new location (specified as in "goto"). The
   transition occurs over <frames> frames.

   All commands must be on separate lines. Use the (somewhat) commented
   glmamejau cabinet as an example to work from.

Common Questions (FAQ)

   Q: I am only getting a few frames-per-second. This sucks! What gives?

   A1: You're probably running Mesa in software mode. You should read the
   "README.3Dfx" file in the Mesa distro. Specifically, you need to
   "setenv MESA_GLX_FX fullscreen".

   A2: You don't have a 3D graphics card. Go buy one (see below)!

   Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just dumps core. That's not as much fun as
   3D Pacman, now is it?

   A1: If you are using a 3Dfx card, make sure you are running xmame.xgl
   as root. Root privileges are required to access the 3Dfx hardware.

   A2: If you're using Mesa and haven't upgraded to v3.0, do so.

   Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just hangs at the initial game screen.

   A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard input
   under KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers.

   Q: Which graphics cards are usable with xmame.xgl?

   A: We have the following experiences (date 20010713):

     * Vodoo3 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2), with command line
       options "-noglaa" and 16bpp X11 server color depth.
     * Vodoo1 + Mesa 3.4 + Glide, with command line options "-glres
       640x480"!
     * GeForce + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 with default
       command line options and 16/24bpp X11 server color depth.
     * NVIDIA TNT2 + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 with command
       line options "-bpp 16" and 16bpp (may be 24bpp also ???) X11
       server color depth (OpenGL colortable mapping is buggy).
     * NVIDIA TNT + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 with command
       line options "-bpp 16" and 16bpp (may be 24bpp also ???) X11
       server color depth (OpenGL colortable mapping is buggy).
     * Matrox MGA 400 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2) with command
       line options "-bpp 16", "-noglaa" (???) and 16bpp (may be 24bpp
       also ???) X11 server color depth (OpenGL colortable mapping is
       buggy).
     * ATI R128 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.1.0) with command line
       options "-noglext78 -noglaa" or "-bpp 16 -noglaa", where the
       latter options are a bit slower (about 5 fps).
     * LinuxPPC - Powerbook-Firewire + ATI R128: see above!

   All of the above drivers work with the option "-bpp 16" and/or
   "-noglext78", the latter of which is very slow, of course! So it looks
   like an OpenGL implementation bug is causing these driver/hardware
   combinations to only work with these command line options. The bug may
   lie within these OpenGL functions:

     * glColorTableEXT
     * glColorSubTableEXT

   Currently fast and funny driver/hardware combinations are:

     * NVIDIA GeForce + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2; I have
       tested the GeForce256 (AGP) hardware.
     * Vodoo + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2); I have tested the
       Vodoo3 hardware.

   Q: When I run xmame.xgl, everything is messed up.

   A: Read the above experiences ... and try

     * switching your X server's bpp value, e.g. switch from 32bpp or
       24bpp to 16bpp;
     * the command line option "-bpp 16";
     * the command line option "-noglaa";
     * the command line option "-noglext".
     _________________________________________________________________

Present Limitations/Bugs

     * No clipping of vector games (most noticeable in cabinet mode).
     * No preservation of game aspect ratio in cabinet mode.
     _________________________________________________________________

Future Work

     * Fixing existing bugs .. are there any ? Or are there some unknown
       features only ;-) ?
     * Optimize the drawing code to update only the changed portions of
       the game bitmap. Optimizing the dirty code ..

   Xmame Mailing List

     * The xmame mailing list is intended to be a technical forum for
       xmame developers, that is,
          + To exchange ideas for producing a better xmame.
          + To share patches and bug notifications.
          + To study new design strategies.
          + To expose problems and learn know-how.
     * The Xmame mailing list is not a forum about playing games (but
       everyone on the list plays...); so please
          + Don't use the list to ask about ROMs.
          + Don't ask about non-UNIX ports of MAME or MESS, just about
            MAME and MESS, xmame and xmess.
          + Don't ask about implementing a game. Just search the docs and
            contribute yourself (you'll enjoy twice: programming and
            playing...).
          + Don't show your last high score in xxx game (we are
            interested in programming, and then playing, in this order).
     * Copyright notice: NEVER, I repeat NEVER send ROM images to the
       list. (But you can tell us where to retrieve them... ;-) )

   If you want to send a personal mail to the xmame/xmess coordinator,
