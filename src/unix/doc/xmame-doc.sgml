<itemize>
 <item>
Optimise mouse warping.
 <item>
Remove osd_input_init_post, add display ready flag.
 <item>
Updating of fps is off (dirty marking problem) with vector games.
 <item>
Update porting.txt.
 <item>
Convert all remaining sound drivers to plugins.
 <item>
Rewrite display/input code to be more modular, oo-ish, and usable
 as a separate library.
 <item>
Split <tt>-&lsqb;no&rsqb;scanline</tt> option into emulated and real scanline
 options.
 <item>
Add an option to specify which resolution to use, add clipping
 and panning if it doesn't fit and use it anyway.
 <item>
Use Pentium TSC for uclock where available.
 <item>
Network:
 <itemize>
  <item>
Fix since the dos team broke it, find out if the dosnet team
 is still alive.
  <item>

Try converting network support to tcp, currently we have no error
 correction.
  <item>
Make network code more robust, version check, input settings
 check, etc.
 </itemize>
 <item>
Check x11-joystick. Rumor has it it's broken, but then again
 there's only one bug-report, so it seems no one is using it.
 <item>
fm soundhack for linux-i386.
 <item>
Make which messages are emitted and when configurable (log-type's
 and log-level), make fileio emit messages about which files it tries
 to open, to help debug rom-loading problems, and walk through all
 messages xmame emits giving them all a standard format like:
 <verb>
OSD:        Info:    bla
X11-window: Warning: bla
Svgalib:    Error:   bla
 </verb>
 <item>
Add scancode 128-255 for non-PC keys like F13 -- F24, more keypad
 keys, etc., update all display targets to use this.

Compiling, Setting Up and Starting Xmame/Xmess
<p>
Note: This section is not a Unix tutorial. You need to know some
 basic  Unix commands to compile and install xmame/xmess.
</p>
<sect1>
Requirements     
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
GNU make is MANDATORY in ALL Systems, even if you use a different
  compiler. 
 <item>
On all platforms zlib is now needed since the core uses it. If
 you don't have zlib, a stripped version is included with xmame. See:
 <ref id="FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?" name="FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not while compiling?" >
 and <ref id="FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?" name="FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?" >

 <item>
You are encouraged to use a GNU development environment: gcc,
 gmake, gnu- ar. Lots of problems are found due to the very permissive
 syntax in gcc, so if you use a strictly ANSI C compiler, you'll get
 lots of warnings, and if the version of xmame/xmess is not fully
 debugged, compilation errors.
 <item>
Xmame compilation breaks when using egcs-1.1.x or gcc-2.95, use
 <tt>-fno-strict-aliasing</tt> to fix it. gcc-2.95.1 does work with <tt>-fstrict-aliasing</tt>,
 and gives a nice speed increase.
 <item>
Xmame compilation also breaks when using Red Hat 7's latest (as
 of 16 January 2001) update for gcc. If you experience problems, please
 either downgrade your compiler to the one included on the Red Hat
 7 CD-ROM, or try replacing "
gcc"
 in the Makefile with "
kgcc"
, which
 will invoke egcs-1.1.2. (But please see above about the <tt>-fstrict-aliasing
 </tt>flag.)
</itemize>
</p><sect1>
Follow these steps to compile xmame/xmess
<p>
<enum>
 <item>
See <ref id="Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems" name="Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems" >
 for platform specific compiling information.
 <item>
See <ref id="Display subsystem specific comments and notes" name="Display subsystem specific comments and notes" >
 for special display methods information.
 <item>
Download the xmame/xmess source files archive.
 <item>
Move the xmame/xmess source files archive to a suitable work
 directory. When you extract the archive, sub directories will be
 created under the  work directory.
 <item>
Rename the source files archive so its extension is .gz, so that
 gzip doesn't complain. For example, change <tt>xmame-0.34b1.1.tgz</tt> to
 <tt>xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz</tt>
 <item>
Use gzip -d to uncompress the archive. For example, type:
 <verb>
gzip -d xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz
 </verb>
 <item>
Extract the files with tar. For example, type:
 <verb>
tar xvf xmame-0.34b1.1.tar
 </verb>
 <item>
After extracting the archive, change to the subdirectory created
 by  the extraction process. For example, after extracting the xmame-0.34b1.1.tar
 archive, a directory named <tt>xmame-0.34b1.1</tt> is created. Change to it.
 This directory is the top of the source tree.
 <item>
Copy makefile.unix to Makefile, the distributed Makefile is used
 for development and is not a good starting point!
 <item>
Edit the <tt>Makefile</tt> and change the settings according to your system.
 The default <tt>makefile.unix</tt> is preconfigured to run under X11/Linux.
 Be careful editing this file.
 <itemize>
  <item>
If you intend to compile in X11 joystick support, type the following
 to see the available Xdevice list:
  <verb>
make xlistdev; ./xlistdev
  </verb>
  <item>
Choose the desired device and re-edit Makefile, setting the option
 X11_JOYNAME to the correct device.
 </itemize>
 <item>
Compile xmame/xmess by typing:
 <verb>
make
 </verb>
 <item>
If the compile fails, report the problem to the author.
 <item>
<bf>*** YOU MAY NEED TO BE root TO PERFORM THIS STEP ***</bf> To install
 xmame/xmess, type:
 <verb>
make install
 </verb>
 <item>
If you want you can now build xmame/xmess for another target/display
 method, otherwise skip to the next step.
 <enum>
  <item>
If you want to also build for another target repeat repeat the
 <tt>"
make"
</tt> and <tt>"
make install"
</tt> steps adding <tt>"
TARGET=&lt;target&gt;"
</tt> to
 the make command for example:
  <verb>
make TARGET=mess
make install
  </verb>
  <item>
If you want to also build for another display method repeat the
 <tt>"
make"
</tt> and <tt>"
make install"
</tt> steps adding <tt>"
DISPLAY_METHOD=&lt;method&gt;"
</tt>
 to the make command for example:
  <verb>
make DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install
  </verb>
  <item>
You can also combine the 2 above for example:
  <verb>
make TARGET=mess DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install
  </verb>
 </enum>
 <item>
In your home directory, create a subdirectory called .xmame.
 <item>
From the top of the source tree, copy the file doc/xmamerc.dist
 to the &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/ directory. (For xmess do
 this for xmessrc)
 <item>
If desired, copy xmamerc.dist to the global xmamerc location
 as &quot;xmamerc&quot; (for xmess, copy xmamerc.dist to xmessrc).
 The global xmamerc location is defined in the Makefile.
 <item>
Edit &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/xmamerc to match your preferences.
 (For xmess, edit &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/xmessrc)
 <item>
Be sure that the DISPLAY and PATH environment variables are 
 set correctly.
 <item>
Make sure your ROM images are installed.
 <item>
Start the X-Window System. (Unless you compiled for a different
 display method in which case you skip this step.)
 <item>
Start xmame/xmess. For example:
 <verb>
/usr/games/xmame.x11 dkong
 </verb>
</enum>

Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems <label id="Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems" >

<sect2>
Linux i386
<p>
Linux i386 is the platform I (Hans) use, so xmame should compile
 without any hassles on Linux i386. (Note: The same is true for Lawrence
 Gold.)
</p>
<p>
Some bugs have been found and worked around when using gcc27x,
 please use egcs if available. If more gcc bugs popup, egcs will be
  made mandatory, but I hope that won't be necessary.
</p>
<p>
It has been reported that some SoundBlaster AWE32 and VIA-82cxxx
 (onboard) cards do not  correctly manage get_freespace(). If so,
 you'll get some audio_ioctl() calls failed messages in console, and
 if everything goes right a message that xmame/xmess is falling back
 to timer based audio. If  this doesn't happen and sound isn't right,
 try forcing timer-based  audio by starting xmame/xmess with <tt>-timer</tt>.
</p>
<p>
SB64/128PCI cards (Ensoniq 137x-based cards) also do not correctly
 manage get_freespace(). Unfortunately, this doesn't result in failed
 ioctl's; instead, they just ignore the calls. Xmame tries to autodetect
 this and to fall back to timer-based audio. If this doesn't happen
 and sound isn't right, try forcing timer based audio by starting
 xmame/xmess with <tt>-timer</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Some have reported success using ALSA with OSS emulation (see
 <url url="http://www.alsa-project.org/" name="http://www.alsa-project.org/">
). If you experience the above problems, this would certainly be
 worth a try.
</p>
<p>
Also, I've tested sound using the PC-Speaker driver module. It
 works!! But it needs <tt>-timer.</tt> Again, it should do this  automagically,
 but you know what to do if it doesn't.
</p>
<p>
Distribution-Specific Comments:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
S.u.S.E. Linux: Besides the gcc compiler and libc libraries,
 which are both from the &quot;d&quot; series, other packages  need
 to be installed or the build will fail. If compiling for svgalib,
 the svgalib package from series &quot;d&quot; installed. If compiling
 for the X-Window System, you must have xdevel package from series
 &quot;x&quot; installed. These packages can be installed using the
 &quot;yast&quot; utility included in the S.u.S.E. distribution.
 <item>
Red Hat Linux is the operating system used by the author. xmame/xmess
  should build correctly under Red Hat Linux. :-)
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Linux PowerPC
<p>
Linux PowerPC should work from now on. Here's an email from Andreas
 Varga <tt><url url="mailto:sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at" name="sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at">

Another thing... sound is not working, because sound drivers
 support is currently under development in Linux/PPC kernels...there
 is an old driver that is a hacked Soundblaster driver, and newer
 2.1.1xx kernels have a sound drivers based on Amiga DMA sound drivers...
 Once this issues are settled there should be a full OSS-compatible
 driver... sound should work then...
</p>
<p>
I can't speak about Joystick support...
</p>
<p>
The original Linux/PPC target changes in the Makefile were done
 by me, but there are some other changes required to get it to compile...
 Starting from October I will have some more time to work on this,
 and I'll keep you updated...
</p>
<p>
Cheers, Andreas
</p>
<sect2>
IRIX
<p>
Use the generic unix arch for those machines that have no  sound
 support installed (xmame/xmess uses the dmedia package or the newer
 AL package on IRIX systems).
</p>
<p>
Silicon Graphics provides several native compilers. xmame/xmess
 has  been compiled and tested with the normal cc. There were some
 problems with this when using -n32 for new style 32bit code. It does
 work when using -o32 for oldstyle 32 bit code. It should now also
 work with -n32 which is much faster.
</p>
<p>
The use of DCC is not recommended (anymore) since it's a C++
  compiler and thus won't even compile xmame/xmess out of the box
 due to uncasted mallocs. Changing all these mallocs would be crazy,
 esp. since they are not only in the osd part, but also in the core
 which is not under our control. Besides that, mame is normal C, so
 please compile it with a normal C compiler.
</p>
<p>
Some problems have been reported using the GNU linker. It's recommended
 that you use the native one.
</p>
<sect2>
HPUX
<p>
Use the generic unix arch. In HP-UX, gcc and gnu-make are MANDATORY.
</p>
<sect2>
ULTRIX 
<p>
Use the generic unix arch.
</p>
<p>
Notes received from Danny <tt><url url="mailto:dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es" name="dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es">
</tt>
</p>
<p>
<bf>VERY IMPORTANT!!!</bf>
</p>
<p>
The xmame/xmess CPU emulators access memory through pointers
 which are sometimes cast to illegal addresses - as far as the MIPS
 CPU is concerned. The Ultrix operating system is aware of that and
 fixes this &quot;unaligned data access&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Depending on your system setup, lots of warnings are generated
 for certain games. Fortunately these messages can be disabled by
  executing the command &quot;uac p 0&quot; in the same shell where
 xmame/xmess  will be running.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: The new <tt>-DALIGN_INTS</tt> switch in the makefile fixes these
 unaligned accesses in the source which is probably a lot faster than
 hot fixing them in the kernel segfault handler.
</p>
<p>
Use gnu make.
</p>
<p>
Compile with the `c89' compiler. Though `gcc' has no problems
  with compiling and optimizing xmame/xmess, the resulting `c89' 
 executable is faster on an empty machine (read: xmame can use all
  cpu &amp; memory without competing with other high priority  processes),
 so you can set `frameskip' to 1.
</p>
<p>
When compiling with `c89 -O2' don't forget to also use `-Olimit
  1000'. If 1000 is not enough, the compiler will tell you to  increase
 it.
</p>
<sect2>
SunOS &amp; Solaris
<p>
There are 2 relevant architecture options available in the makefile:
 
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    ARCH = generic : use this for old SunOs running on Sparcs,
                     but a Sparc running Solaris will usually
                     handle this option too.
    ARCH = solaris : this is the one you should use for Sparcs
                     running Solaris.        
</verb>
</p><p>
Currently sound is not supported under sunos. The solaris arch
 does support audio.
</p>
<p>
If you are using Sun's OpenWindows implementation of X11, then
 make sure that the X11INC and X11LIB variables in the X11 Options
 section of the makefile are set properly. (There are already entries
 for the standard OpenWin directory there that you can uncomment.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you are compiling for X11 then you need to set
 these variables properly, no matter what implementation of X11 you
 are using!  :)
</p>
<p>
If you are using Sun's SunPro cc compiler, then the following
 optimisation flags have been reported to be good:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    OPTFLAGS    = -fast -xO4 -native
</verb>
</p><p>
Finally, there has been a case of the xmame compilation processes
 breaking over the &quot;ar&quot; program. Most Solaris installations
 will include a set of utilities that conform to the XPG4 standard,
 usually in the &quot;/usr/xpg4/bin&quot; directory. The XPG4 version
 of &quot;ar&quot; should be avoided like the plague. Ensure that
 the &quot;/usr/ccs/bin&quot; appears in your path before the &quot;/usr/xpg4/bin&quot;
 directory and everything should go smoothly.
</p>
<p>
PLEASE NOTE : There is currently not much support for SunOS/Solaris.
 If you have any trouble, try to fix it yourself. If you succeed,
 send a message to the mailing list detailing what you did. If you
 don't succeed, send a message anyway and someone _may_ be able to
 help you. Either way, this is the only way that problems with xmame
 on SunOS/Solaris will get fixed.
</p>
<sect2>
Openstep
<p>
You must use the OpenStep gnumake, not make. You must also use
 the NeXT/Apple cc rather than gcc. Also use only the optimisation
 options as recommended for OpenStep in the makefile, others will
 cause the resulting executable to crash. The OpenStep assembler on
 i386 architectures is incompatible with the mame assembler CPU cores
 and thus you must use the C versions (Use i386-noasm instead of i386
 when compiling for i386).
</p>
<p>
The supplied complier is based on gcc 2.7.2.1 which will not
 compile src/profiler.c without crashing. To get around this you must
 turn off + optimisation when this crash occurs, re-make to compile
 this file only, then stop the make, re-enable optimisation, and continue.
</p>
<p>
On an OpenStep keyboard the functions keys do not all operate
 as expected. Using the command key in conjuction with a number key
 generates the equivalent function key within xmame, with 0, - and
 = + representing F10, F11 and F12 resepectively. Also note that the
 ALT + keys cannot be mapped. As most games tend to use this as the
 default fire button it is exteremly useful to remap this globally
 the first time you run xmame.
</p>
<sect>
Xmame Frequently Asked Questions<label id="Xmame frequently asked questions" >

<sect1>
What is mame?
<p>
Mame is an arcade machine emulator. Started in 1997 by Nicola
  Salmoria, mame started out as a series of emulators for  individual
 games. This series of emulators was combined into a  simgle multi-game
 emulator. This is the current form of mame; no longer a one-man show,
 there are over 100 contributors to the project.
</p>
<p>
Mame was created by Nicola Salmoria.
</p>
<p>
Also see <url url="readme.mame" name="the official mame readme file (readme.mame)">

</p>
<sect1>
What is mess?
<p>
Mess is just like mame---a virtual machine emulator, only it
 doesn't emulate arcade machines but rather computers and consoles.
</p>
<p>
Also see <url url="readme.mess" name="the official mess readme file (readme.mess)">

</p>
<sect1>
What is xmame/xmess?
<p>
Xmame/xmess are the Unix/X11 ports of the mame and mess projects.
 It makes mame/mess available on *ix machines using the X11R6 X-Window
 System (and SVGAlib/ggi/XF86-DGA/OpenGL/SDL too).
</p>
<p>
Mame was orginally ported by Allard Van Der Bas, Dick the Ridder,
 Juan Antonio Martinez, and Hans de Goede.
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess is currently maintained by Lawrence Gold.
</p>
<sect1>
What are the differences between mame/mess and xmame/xmess?
<p>
None significant.
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess is based on the mame/mess source code. Due to technical
 reasons beyond the scope of this document, the mame/mess source may
 not compile under Unix. That's why the xmame/xmess project exists.
 Each time mame/mess is updated, the code is tested  (and patched
 if needed) under Unix. This way xmame/xmess releases are always the
 same as their mame counterparts.
</p>
<p>
There are no plans for the independent development of xmame/xmess.
</p>
<sect1>
What hardware and operating systems are supported?     
<p>
Xmame runs on both little-endian and big-endian CPUs, using aligned
 integer access if needed and is compatible with 64 bit CPUs. The
 current list of supported CPUs in the makefile is:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
i386 + gnu-asm
 <item>
i386 no asm
 <item>
alpha
 <item>
ia64 (merced)
 <item>
m68k
 <item>
generic risc (PowerPC, Sparc, HPPA, IBM)
 <item>
generic risc, lsb-first (RISC (Ultrix machines))
 <item>
mips (generic risc + SGI compiler bug workarounds)
</itemize>
</p><p>
Adding support for another cpu (if necessary) should be trivial.
</p>
<p>
The following Unix platforms are specifically supported:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Linux
 <item>
FreeBSD
 <item>
NetBSD
 <item>
Solaris (SunOS)
 <item>

</p><p>
The generic unix entry should work for any reasonable standard
 Unix variant, but lacks sound since there is no single Unix sound
 standard.

On all platforms, zlib is now needed since the core uses it.
 Ff you don't have zlib, use the included one by uncommenting the
 appropriate line in Makefile.

We are always looking for people willing to test and answer questions
 about xmame on a new arch/os/display. This takes very little work
 and could help other people tremendously. If you're interested, mail
 Lawrence <tt><url url="mailto:gold@aros.net" name="gold@aros.net">
</tt>.
</p>
<sect1>
My system is supported but xmame/xmess gives me errors and fails.
 Why?
<p>
Xmame/xmess should run on 8bpp Pseudo Color displays and on 16,
 24 and 32bpp True Color displays. If your X-Server does not support
 any  of these display types, xmame/xmess will not run.
</p>
<p>
You can verify your X-Server support by starting your X-Server
  and running the xdpyinfo program. See the xdpyinfo manual page 
 for more information.
</p>
<sect1>
What is the role of the xmamerc/xmessrc file?
<p>
A normal xmame/xmess invocation looks like:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    xmame pacman -sound -nojoy -frameskip 2 -heightscale 3 &bsol;   
        -widthscale 2
</verb>
</p><p>
Most of the time, you will want to use the same configuration
 for  each game. xmame/xmess will read this file for default values
 for the  parameters that you can set. This way the only parameters
 you  need to express on the command line are the ones you want to
  override.
</p>
<p>
Another reason for xmamerc/xmessrc is keyboard remapping. Some
 Unix  keyboards are very different than their PC counterparts. To
  compensate for the changes, xmame/xmess allows you to remap keys
 that  are not available on Unix keyboards to keys that are available.
</p>
<sect1>
What is the syntax of the xmamerc/xmessrc file.
<p>
The syntax is quite simple:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
   &quot;keyword value&quot;
</verb>
</p><p>
See <url url="xmamerc.dist" name="xmamerc.dist">
 for most keywords. Allmost all commandline options can
 be used as keywords (without the -), use value 0 or 1 for commandline
 options which have a negating (-no&lsqb;option&rsqb;) counterpart.
 As usual lines begining with &quot;&num;&quot; are comments.
</p>
<p>
You can also generate a configfile with all the current settings
 to use as a template by typing:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
   xmame -showconfig &gt; &tilde;/.xmame/xmamerc
</verb>
</p><sect1>
Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc
 go? <label id="FAQ: Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc go?" >

<sect2>
Roms/Samples
<p>
Xmame/xmess uses a &quot;:&quot; seperated rompath to find out
 which dirs to search for roms/samples.
</p>
<p>
The default rompath is XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile during
 compile.
</p>
<p>
This is overwritten by any rompath in xmamerc/xmessrc, which
 can be overwritten again with the -rompath commandline option.
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess searches every dir in this path for roms/samples
 in the following way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename.zip             (containing filename.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.ext
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.ext.gz (containing filename.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.zip    (containing filename.ext)
</verb>
</p><p>
So let's say that we are searching for rom0001.1, which is part
 of pacman. Then xmame/xmess would search every dir in your rompath
 for
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman.zip               (containing rom0001.1)
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.1
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.1.gz      (containing rom0001.1)
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.zip       (containing rom0001.1)
</verb>
</p><p>
Note: If your neogeo games can't find neogeo.rom, put it in a
 dir called neogeo somewhere in your rompath, or put it in neogeo.zip
 somewhere in your rompath.
</p>
<sect2>
Read/write Diskette Images
<p>
This section only applies to xmess emulations which support read/write
 diskette images and thus try to open the image read/write.
</p>
<p>
Xmess first searches for read/write images with the name specified
 on the commandline:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext
</verb>
</p><p>
where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline.
 This way, absolute and relative filenames can be used directly on
 the commandline for an image which is not in the rompath.
</p>
<p>
Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for roms/samples
 in the following way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext
</verb>
</p><p>
Note that (g)zipped images are not supported for r/w images.
</p>
<sect2>
Rom Cartridges/Read Only Diskette Images
<p>
Xmess begins by searching for cartdriges/disks from the current
 dir in the following way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext.gz            (containing image.ext)
    &lt;path&gt;/image.zip               (containing image.ext)
</verb>
</p><p>
where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline.
 This way, absolute and relative filenames can be used directly on
 the commandline for an image which is not in the rompath.
</p>
<p>
Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for carts/images
 in the following way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext.gz             (containing image.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.zip                (containing image.ext)
</verb>
</p><p>
Finally, xmess searches the rompath as desribed above using the
 systemtype for gamename.
</p>
<p>
So let's say we want to play mario.nes on the nes emulation of
 xmess. We would then type: &quot;xmess nes mario.nes&quot;. Xmess
 then begins by searching the current dir for
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    mario.nes
    mario.nes.gz                   (containing mario.nes)
    mario.zip                      (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
After that, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.nes
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.nes.gz             (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.zip                (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
And finally, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes.zip                  (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.nes
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.nes.gz         (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.zip            (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
Since xmess first searches for cartridges/disks from the current
 dir you can also specify cartridges/disks not in your rompath. For
 example:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &quot;xmess nes ../mario.nes&quot;
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmess then searches for
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    ../mario.nes
    ../mario.nes.gz                (containing mario.nes)
    ../mario.zip                   (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
and will also search the rompath as described above with ../mario.nes
 as the image name but this is not that useful.
</p>
<sect2>
Artwork
<p>
Xmame/xmess searches every dir in the rompath for artwork in
 the following way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.png.gz           (containing artwork.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.zip              (containing artwork.png)
</verb>
</p><p>
Then xmame/xmess searches the rompath as in roms/samples.
</p>
<p>
So let's say we want to play foo which uses bar.png. Xmame/xmess
 then begins searching each dir in your rompath for
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.png.gz               (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.zip                  (containing bar.png)
</verb>
</p><p>
And then xmame/xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo.zip                  (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.png.gz           (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.zip              (containing bar.png)
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Xmame configuration
<p>
Xmame looks for the following configuration files and parses
 each one found. Files parsed later can overwrite options in previously
 parsed files:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    XMAMEROOT/xmamerc
    XMAMEROOT/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/xmamerc
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/rc/&lt;gamename&gt;rc
</verb>
</p><p>
<tt>XMAMEROOT</tt> is defined during compile time, see Makefile.
</p>
<p>
<tt>DISPLAY_METHOD</tt> is the <tt>DISPLAY_METHOD</tt> for which xmame was compiled,
 this can be one of: x11, svgalib, ggi, xgl, xfx, svgafx, openstep,
 SDL.
</p>
<p>
For xmess of course replace xmame by xmess. ;)
</p>
<sect2>
Game configuration
<p>
Game configuration files are kept on a per-user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/cfg/&lt;game&gt;.cfg resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/cfg/&lt;game&gt;.cfg
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Game state
<p>
Game state files are kept on a per-user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/sta/&lt;game&gt;.sta resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/sta/&lt;game&gt;.sta
</verb>
</p><sect2>
NVram
<p>
NVram files are kept on a per-user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/nvram/&lt;game&gt;.nv resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/nvram/&lt;game&gt;.nv
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Mem cards
<p>
Mem cards files are kept on a per-user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/mem/&lt;filename&gt;.mem resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/mem/&lt;filename&gt;.mem
</verb>
</p><p>
Where &lt;filename&gt; is given by the game-driver. 
</p>
<sect2>
Screenshots
<p>
Screenshots, which can be made by pressing F12, are saved as
 png files in the directory from where xmame is started (cwd).
</p>
<p>
This can be overidden by the screenshotdir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc,
 which can again be overidden by the <tt>-screenshotdir</tt> cmdline-option.
</p>
<p>
They are saved as:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;screenshotdir&gt;/&lt;game&gt;xxxx.png
    Where xxxx is a number.
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Highscores
<p>
Highscores are stored in XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile when
 building. This can be overidden by the spooldir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc,
 which can again be overidden by the <tt>-spooldir</tt> cmdline-option.
</p>
<p>
So only give a 
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    drwxrwsr-x root games &lt;spooldir&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
permission and setgid xmame/xmess to &quot;games&quot; to get
 it to work. Note this doesn't work with suid root versions (svgalib
 &amp; XF86-DGA), suggestions welcome.
</p>
<p>
For now use <tt>&dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame</tt> or <tt>&dollar; &lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess</tt>
 as the spooldir in xmamerc/xmessrc for  suid root versions.
</p>
<p>
Note: For highscores to work, xmame must also be able to find
 hiscore.dat.
</p>
<sect2>
hiscore.dat
<p>
If you want to use highscores mame needs to load hiscore.dat
 to get highscore info.
</p>
<p>
The default is <tt>XMAMEROOT</tt>/hiscore.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
 compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the hiscorefile
 entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden by the
 cmdline-option <tt>-hiscorefile</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>hiscore.dat</tt> is available from the mame homepage: <url url="http://www.mame.net" name="http://www.mame.net">

</p>
<sect2>
cheat.dat
<p>
If you want to use cheats mame needs to load cheat.dat to get
 cheat info.
</p>
<p>
The default is XMAMEROOT/cheat.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
 compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the cheatfile
 entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden by the
 cmdline-option <tt>-cheatfile</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>cheat.dat</tt> is available from the mame homepage: <url url="http://www.mame.net" name="http://www.mame.net">

</p>
<sect2>
history.dat
<p>
If you want to display some nice background info on games, mame
 needs to load history.dat.
</p>
<p>
The default is XMAMEROOT/history.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
 compile-time, see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the historyfile
 entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden by the
 cmdline-option <tt>-historyfile</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>history.dat</tt> is available from the mame homepage: <url url="http://www.mame.net" name="http://www.mame.net">

Input logs
<p>
Input logs are saved/read under the name specified after the
 <tt>-record / -playback</tt> option; this name is relative to the current
 path.
</p>
<sect2>
Xmame/xmess still can't find files/store highscores
<p>
Type <tt>&quot;xmame/xmess -showconfig | more&quot;</tt> and check that
 the rompath and spooldir shown are correct and readable/writable.
 Otherwise recheck xmamerc/xmessrc. Remember that xmess also searches
 the current dir.
</p>
<sect1>
How do I start xmess/xmame ?
<p>
To start xmame, type
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    xmame &lsqb;options&rsqb; &lt;gamename&gt; &lsqb;more options&rsqb;
</verb>
</p><p>
For xmess, type
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    xmess &lsqb;options&rsqb; &lt;systemname&gt; &lsqb;more options&rsqb; &bsol;
    &lt;disk/romimage(s)&gt; &lsqb;more options&rsqb;
</verb>
</p><p>
All options are optional. ;)
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess supports most dos command line options (see readme.mame
 / readme.mess) as well as a few of its own: Type xmame -help |  more
 for a complete list.
</p>
<p>
With xmess, some systems don't require a disk/romimage, but most
 do.
</p>
<sect1>
What are the command line parameters for xmame/xmess?
<p>
To see a list of available parameters, type:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    /usr/games/xmame -help | more
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmame/xmess supports most of the command line parameters as the
 DOS  version as well a some of its own.
</p>
<p>
See the file readme.mame / readme.mess for more information about
 the command line parameters.
</p>
<sect1>
What keys does xmame/xmess use?
<p>
Xmame/xmess uses the same key-bindings as the DOS version of
 mame: The following keys work in all emulators:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    `  or &tilde;      Enter On screen display to change volume, brightness etc.
    Tab          Enter configuration menu. Press Tab or Esc to get back to
                 the emulation.
    P            Pause
    F3           Reset
    F4           Show the game graphics. Use cursor keys to change set/color,
                 F4 or Esc to return to the emulation.
    F8           Reduce frame skip
    F9           Increase frameskip
    F10          Toggle speed throttling
    F10 + shift  Toggle idle sleeping
    F11          Toggle speed display
    F11 + shift  Toggle profiler display
    F12          Save a screen snapshot
    ESC          Exit emulator
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmame has 2 different auto frameskipping algorithms. These can
 be selected with the -frameskipper option and with key combos:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Key combo:             Gives you the:
    left-ctrl + insert     standard dos frameskipper
    left-ctrl + home       William Barath's frameskipper
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmame's display scaling can be controlled on the fly with the
 following key combos:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Key combo:             Result:
    left-shift + insert    Increase widthscale
    left-shift + delete    Decrease widthscale
    left-shift + home      Increase heightscale
    left-shift + end       Decrease heightscale
    left-shift + pageup    Increase scale
    left-shift + pagedown  Decrease scale
</verb>
</p><p>
Under X11, xmame can switch to and from different modes during
 runtime: 
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Key combo:             Warps you to:
    left-alt + insert      Normal window
    left-alt + home        DGA fullscreen mode
</verb>
</p><p>
Under SDL, xmame can switch to and from different modes during
 runtime:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Key combo:             Result:
    left-alt + enter       Toggles between windowed and
                           fullscreen modes.
</verb>
</p><p>
Under X11 in a window, you can also grab the mouse. To be able
 to play with the mouse, press left-alt + page-down to grab the mouse,
 and press it again to release it.
</p>

Why doesn't a game have sound?

<itemize>
 <item>
First check that sound is working in other applications.
 <item>
Check that sound is supported for the game that has no sound;
 not all games have sound.
 <item>
For xmame, take a look at gamelist.mame: Is the sound for the
 game emulated?
 <item>
For xmess take a look at readme.mess: Is the sound for the system
 emulated?
 <item>
Check the operating system support chart in the earlier part
 of  this file: Does xmame/xmess support sound on your system?
</itemize>
</p><sect1>
My sound seems lagged. / My sound Clicks. / What does -bufsize
 do?
<p>
With the <tt>-bufsize</tt> commandline option or the bufsize configfile
 keyword, you can specify the number of frames of audio to buffer.
 The default is 2 frames.
</p>
<p>
This value should be ok for everyone, but if you still have problems,
 read on.
</p>
<p>
If the buffersize is to small, this causes the buffer to get
 empty between frames which in turn causes clicks/pauses in the sound.
 If this is the case, increasing the -bufsize value to, for example,
 2.5 should help.
</p>
<p>
If, however, you make the buffersize too large, then so much
 audio becomes buffered, that the sound could become lagged. E.g.,
 you would hear the coin drop sound 0.5 seconds after pressing the
 insert coin key. In this case, lower the bufsize to, for example,
 1.5.
</p>
<p>
Please let me know if you need to change this setting, since
 I'm planning on removing it in a future release.

Why doesn't a game work? <label id="FAQ: Why doesn't a game work?" >

<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Do you have the right roms or did you get checksum failures?
 <item>
Xmame version 0.34 and higher require PROM files that were not
 included in ROM images released before version 0.34. See the question
 on PROMs  below for more information.
 <item>
For xmame, check the file gamelist.mame to see if the game is
 playable. Just because a game is included doesn't mean it is working
 yet.
 <item>
For xmess, take a look at readme.mess. Maybe the system isn't
 emulated all that well yet.
 <item>
Some games require sound support. If you don't have sound  support
 under your Unix installation or sound isn't supported by xmame/xmess
 for you, try the <tt>-fakesound</tt> command line parameter.
</itemize>
</p><sect1>
What are PROMs? <label id="FAQ: What are PROMs?" >

<p>
PROMs contain game-specific information that used to be built
 in  to mame in versions prior to 0.34. This information has been
  extracted and is now included with new versions of ROM files for
  games that require this information.
</p>
<p>
If you want to use your current ROM files, you can obtain just
 the PROM images in one large file at:

<sect1>
Why is xmame/xmess slow?
<p>
Xmame/xmess is a compiled C program that is emulating hardware.
  Software emulation of hardware always incurs a speed penalty. Here
  are some things you can do:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Try using the -frameskip command line parameter.
 <item>
Try pressing F8 while running xmame/xmess to alter the frame
 rate.
 <item>
Try disabling the throttle with the -nothrottle command line
  parameter or by pressing F10 while running xmame/xmess.
 <item>
While running xmame/xmess, press F11 to check the speed of xmame/xmess.
  If you never get a display of 100&percnt;, you need a faster computer.
</itemize>
</p><p>
You can also try recompiling xmame/xmess with more optimal settings.
 The following suggestions may not work or may not be appropriate
 on some machines and in some installations.  However, in cases where
 they do work, there can be a noticeable increase in overall performance
 of xmame/xmess.
</p>
<p>
These &quot;enhancements&quot; simply require editing the Makefile
 that is distributed with xmame, and then recompiling the source.
  If you are compiling the source for the second time you will need
 to do:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    make clean
    make
    make install
</verb>
</p><p>
after editing the Makefile to set your new settings.
</p>
<sect2>
SPEEDUP &num; 1 - Inline compiling
<p>
Try enabling inline compiling by commenting and uncommenting
 the following lines:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &num; IL    = '-DINLINE=static inline'
    IL     = -DINLINE=static
</verb>
</p><sect2>
SPEEDUP &num; 2 - Direct Graphics Access
<p>
For a big boost, try enabling DGA by uncommenting the following
 line:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    DGA = 1
</verb>
</p><p>
Then start xmame as root, and press left-alt + home to switch
 to dga mode; that should be a lot faster, and doesn't need/use xsync.
 ;) 
</p>
<p>
To get back to a window without exiting, press left-alt + insert.
</p>
<p>
The benefit of DGA is that it is Direct Graphics Access and therefore
 writes directly to the framebuffer (think DirectX versus GDI under
 MS Windows). So it should be a tad faster, unless you've got a really
 really well accelerated X-server, which could be just as fast. Try
 pressing F11 to see the actual framerate, although it might be hardly
 noticable (visually, at least), it should give you some speed increase.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, it automatically switches to the right mode and
 removes any window manager stuff, but that can be done without DGA
 too. (I might add such a feature later, since it allows easy fullscreen
 without running as root.)
</p>
<p>
Adding a 320x240 mode will most definitely get you a very nice
 fullscreen display at scale = 1. ;)
</p>
<p>
Don't forget that you still need to set up the Modes line of
 the   &quot;Display&quot; subsection of the &quot;Screen&quot; section
 in your X11 config file if you want the games to fill the screen
 in DGA mode. Xmame will pick the best mode it can find, so if you
 have a line like
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Modes  &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot; &quot;320x240&quot; &quot;256x224&quot;
</verb>
</p><p>
then any game which fits into a 320x240 screen can be displayed
 in that resolution, and so on. Don't forget your X11 config file
 might have a number of different &quot;Screen&quot; sections in it,
 and you will need to add Modes to the one that is actually active
 with your Xserver is running. And of course it's not always that
 easy, since you also need to tell X which monitor settings are required
 for these resolution modes. This is done through Modeline entries
 in the &quot;Monitor&quot; section of your X config file.
</p>
<p>
You can check out the <tt>/contrib/tools/modelines</tt> file for a set
 of crazy modes made especially for xmame in DGA mode. They should
 work on any reasonable multisync monitor, but don't use them on an
 old fixed-frequency monitor. (And if you can't resist trying, I won't
 pay for a new one!)
</p>
<sect2>
SPEEDUP &num; 3 - NASM
<p>
You can also try installing nasm and compiling the asm core,
 that helps a bit too.
</p>
<sect1>
I've got a dual processor machine. What can I do to take full
 advantage of this?
<p>
Not much. Xmame is a single-threaded port of a single-threaded
 DOS app. Some degree of speedup will hopefully be found on an SMP
 machine since xmame is more likely to get to hog its one CPU for
 longer. But of course the same applies to any CPU-intensive program.
 And all the things one would normally do to any application to give
 it more CPU time (higher priority, kill or renice unecessary process,
 etc.) will work with xmame.
</p>
<p>
Now you may at this point be thinking, "
Surely you could have
 one thread doing emulation and another thead doing graphics to get
 a speedup."
 Yes, but there are some serious issues to consider. The
 first is synchronisation between the threads, which needs to be pretty
 tight. If not done smoothly. the overhead will blow most of the benefit
 away. Also, it needs to be implemented with a portable threads interface
 ... which basically means POSIX threads. In a nutshell, it's a lot
 of effort for probably not much gain. But of course if you are feeling
 particulary energetic and in the mood to code, then patches can always
 be submitted to the xmame devel mailing list ... :)

Why doesn't my joystick handle diagonal movement correctly on
 my Intel x86 system?
<p>
Xmame/xmess uses autocalibrating, but you could try to use specific
 programs to calibrate it (jscal that comes with joystick  module
 works fine....).
</p>
<sect1>
How do I enable XinputExtensions X11 based joystick in Xfree86?
<p>
You need to edit XF86Config to enable the XInput section. See
 the  manual page for XF86Config.
</p>
<sect1>
How do I read a manual page?
<p>
Easy. If you want to read the manual page for XF86Config, type:
 man XF86Config

Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling? <label id="FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?" >

<p>
Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some compression
 routines. Unfortunately, a lot of Linux distributions have an old
 version of zlib installed as /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a, and the new version
 installed as /usr/lib/libz.a. If this is the case, it's harmless
 to remove /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a. If you're not sure whether this
 is the case, just move /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a to another location.
</p>
<p>
Removing or just moving /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a should fix this
 problem.

<p>
Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some compression
 routines.
</p>
<p>
Zlib is standard on most Unix versions. For those who don't ship
 with zlib or ship with a version that is too old, xmame/xmess now
 comes with a stripped-down version of zlib. Uncomment the appropriate
 line in the Makefile to use this.

FXmame, a glide driver for xmame
<p>
The latest version of this driver can be obtained at <url url="http://glmame.linuxgames.com" name="http://glmame.linuxgames.com">
.
</p>
<sect2>
Requirements
<p>
To run FXmame, you must have:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
A 3Dfx card
 <item>
Glide 2x
 <item>
The xmame distribution
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Compiling and Installing
<p>
FXmame comes in two flavours---xfx and svgafx. The xfx version
 is designed to run under X11. It uses an X window for input. The
 svgafx version runs from the console, and uses svgalib for input.
 Both use the 3Dfx hardware for rendering.
</p>
<p>
To install FXmame, follow the general instructions for installing
 xmame. To specify the glide driver, do the following to the Makefile:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Select either &quot;xfx&quot; or &quot;svgafx&quot; as your display
 method
 <item>
Configure the glide variables to correspond to your glide setup
</itemize>
</p><p>
The FXmame executables are called &quot;xmame.xfx&quot; and &quot;xmame.svgafx&quot;
</p>
<sect2>
Running
<p>
FXmame runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard
 commands that xmame.x11 does.
</p>
<p>
A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the glide driver:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
RIGHTCTRL-A -- toggle antialiasing in vector games 
 <item>
RIGHTCTRL-B -- toggle bilinear filtering
</itemize>
</p><p>
The glide driver also adds several command-line options:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    -fxgama &lt;value&gt; 3Dfx gamma correction value
</verb>
</p><p>
Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display
 in vector games, I have to overlay the game bitmap over the vector
 display. This is because I circumvent the bitmap entirely in vector
 games. Drawing the bitmap is a big cpu hog, so you'll notice that
 the game slows down when you turn on the fps display (I know, not
 ideal when you want to find out the frame rate...).
</p>
<sect2>
Common Questions (FAQ)
<p>
Q: When I run FXmame, it just dumps core.
</p>
<p>
A: Make sure you are running FXmame as root. Root privileges
 are required to access the 3Dfx hardware
</p>
<p>
Q: When I run xmame.xfx, it just hangs at the initial game screen.
</p>
<p>
A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard
 input under KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers
 or use xmame.svgafx instead.
</p>

GLmame, an OpenGL driver for xmame
<p>
The latest version of this driver can be obtained at: <url url="http://www.jausoft.com/glmame.html" name="http://www.jausoft.com/glmame.html">

</p>
<sect2>
Requirements
<p>
To run GLmame you must have:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
An OpenGL implementation
 <item>
libjpeg
 <item>
hardware 3D acceleration (if you want any kind of framerate)
 <item>
the xmame distribution
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Compiling and Installing
<p>
Follow the general instructions for installing xmame. To specify
 the OpenGL driver, do the following in the Makefile:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Select &quot;xgl&quot; as your display method.
 <item>
For runtime printed debug info, add "
-DGLDEBUG"
 to the "
GLCFLAGS&quot;
 variable.
 <item>
GLU version 1.2 is recommended (e.g., from SGI). If you use Mesa's
 GLU, you may have to add "
-DGLU_VERSION_1_2"
 to the "
GLCFLAGS"
.
</itemize>
</p><p>
The GLmame executable is called &quot;xmame.xgl&quot;.
</p>
<sect2>
Running
<p>
xmame.xgl runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard
 commands that xmame.x11 does.
</p>
<p>
The program starts up in cabinet mode. While this is pretty,
 and cool, you'll probably want to actually play in fullscreen mode.
</p>
<p>
A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the OpenGL driver:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-A -- toggle antialias filtering (vector)
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-B -- toggle bilinear filtering (raster)
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-C -- toggle cabinet/fullscreen display (both)
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-F -- toggle between fullscreen (max window size) and
 startup window size (both)
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-O -- toggle draw-bitmap (both; nonsense for raster
 games, speedup for vector games)
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-T -- toggle phosphor trails (vector)
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-PLUS_PAD -- incr. beam size (vector)
 <item>
RIGHT_ALT-MINUS_PAD -- decr. beam size (vector)
</itemize>
</p><p>
The OpenGL driver also adds several command-line options:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;fullscreen         Start in fullscreen mode
                            (default: disabled)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;gldblbuffer        Disable/enable double buffering
                            (default: enabled)

    -gltexture_size &lt;int&gt;   Force the max width and height of one 
                            texture segment (default: autosize)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glforceblitmode /  Force blitter for true color modes 15/32bpp
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glblit             (default: enabled)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glext78 /          Force the usage of GL extension number 78,
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glext              if available (palletted texture)
                            (default: enabled)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glbilinear /       Disable/enable bilinear filtering
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glbilin            (default: enabled)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;gldrawbitmap /     Disable/enable drawing the bitmap; e.g., 
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glbitmap           disable within vector games for a speedup
                            (default: enabled)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glcolormod         Disable/enable color modulation (intensity,
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glcmod             gamma)
                            (default: enabled)

    -glbeam &lt;float&gt;         Set the beam size for vector games
                            (default: 1.0)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glalphablending /  Disable/enable alpha blending if available
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glalpha            (default: enabled)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glantialias /      Disable/enable antialiasing
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;glaa               (default: enabled)

    -gllibname /            Choose the dynamically loaded OpenGL
    -gllib &lt;string&gt;         library
                            (default: libGL.so)

    -glulibname /           Choose the dynamically loaded GLU library
    -glulib &lt;string&gt;        (default: libGLU.so)

    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;cabview            Don't start/start in cabinet view mode
                            (default: don't start in this mode)

    -cabinet &lt;cabname&gt;      Specify which cabinet model to use
                            (default: glmamejau)

</verb>
</p><p>
Three cabinet models are provided. The default, &quot;glmamejau&quot;,
 is designed to look like a standard arcade cabinet, like &quot;glmame&quot;.
 The last one, &quot;trans&quot;, is a box with a transparent game
 screen.
</p>
<p>
Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display
 in vector games, the game's bitmap is overlaid above the vector display.
 Drawing the bitmap is a big cpu hog for some low-end hardware accelerated
 OpenGL implementations, so you'll notice that the game slows down
 when the bitmap is overlaid.
</p>
<p>
Because bitmap overlaying is the default, you can toggle it on
 and off by pressing the &quot;RIGHT_ALT-O&quot; key, or turn it off
 at startup by using the command line option &quot;-noglbitmap&quot;.
</p>
<p>
A problem with vector games and the cabinet mode is that some
 vector points do not reside within the screen coordinates, so you
 may see some vectors outside of the cabinet's mame display.
</p>
<p>

<p>
If you have trouble with GLmame, or it is slow, read the &quot;Common
 Questions&quot; section. Most of the questions people email me are
 answered here.
</p>
<sect2>
Cabinet Models
<p>
Cabinet model information is stored in the &quot;cab&quot; subdirectory
 of the directory you specified with the ROMPATH variable in the Makefile.
 Path information specified in xmamerc or with the 'rompath' shell
 environment variable is currently not used. Each cabinet model has
 it's own subdirectory. GLmame will first try to load either the user-specified
 cabinet model (using the -cabinet command-line option), or a model
 corresponding to the current game name. Failing that, it will use
 the generic &quot;glmame&quot; model.
</p>
<p>
A cabinet model directory must contain a geometry file &lt;modelname&gt;.cab,
 and any .jpg files used for textures on the model. The format of
 the .cab file will be familiar if you have ever programmed using
 OpenGL -- it looks much like an OpenGL display list. The format is
 as follows:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    cabv1.1
</verb>
</p><p>
This header must be the first 7 characters of the file.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &num;&lt;text&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Comment lines begin with '&num;'
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    begin &lt;type&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Begins a geometry object, where type is one of (points, polygon,
 quads, quad_strip, screen). Each &quot;begin&quot; must be paired
 with an &quot;end&quot; statement. A &quot;polygon&quot; is specified
 using one vertex per, well... vertex. &quot;quads&quot; are four-sided
 polygons, each specified by four vertices in order around the polygon.
 A &quot;quad_strip&quot; is a series of four-sided polygons, each
 of which shares an edge with the polygons before and after it in
 the strip. A &quot;screen&quot; is a quad that defines the actual
 area in 3D space where the game will be displayed. only one of these
 should be defined. For more info, look at any description of OpenGL
 geometry.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    end
</verb>
</p><p>
Ends the geometry object begun with &quot;begin&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    pointsize &lt;s&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Changes the current pointsize to the corresponding size value
 (specified as a floating point number between 0.0 and, e.g., 20.0).
 Note: You cannot use this statement between begin and end!
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    color4 &lt;r&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Changes the current color to the corresponding rgb value (specified
 as floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
</p>

<verb>
    color4 &lt;r&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;a&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Changes the current color to the corresponding rgba value (specified
 as floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    shading &lt;type&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Sets the shading type. available types are &quot;smooth&quot;
 (which blends colors from one vertex to the next) or &quot;flat&quot;
 (which doesn't).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    vertex &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Specifies a vertex for the current geometry object as a point
 in 3-space.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    numtex &lt;num&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Specifies the number of different textures to be loaded. This
 declaration must precede any &quot;loadtex&quot; call.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    loadtex &lt;num&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Loads texture number &lt;num&gt; from .jpg file &lt;filename&gt;.
 The .jpg file *must* be &lt;width&gt; by &lt;height&gt; pixels, and
 both &lt;width&gt; and &lt;height&gt; must be powers of two (and
 must conform to the hardware requirements of any 3D card you want
 the cabinet to work with -- 256x256 for 3Dfx).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    texcoord &lt;xcoord&gt; &lt;ycoord&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Sets the texture coordinate of the next vertex. This specifies
 where in 2D texture space the vertex lies.
</p>

Turns off texture mapping.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    settex &lt;num&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>

 previously have been loaded using &quot;loadtex&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    camerapan &lt;num&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Starts the camera pan definition that will be followed by &lt;num&gt;
 camera transistions. After the last transision definition, the pan
 sequence must be ended with an &quot;end&quot; statement.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    goto &lt;lx&gt; &lt;ly&gt; &lt;lz&gt; &lt;px&gt; &lt;py&gt; &lt;pz&gt; &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Relocates and reorients the camera. The arguments are the same
 as are used by the OpenGL command &quot;gluLookAt()&quot;. The camera
 is positioned at point &lt;lx,ly,lz&gt;, pointing along vector &lt;px,py,pz&gt;,
 with &quot;up&quot; normal (the direction that is &quot;up&quot;
 for the camera) &lt;nx,ny,nz&gt;.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    moveto &lt;lx&gt; &lt;ly&gt; &lt;lz&gt; &lt;px&gt; &lt;py&gt; &lt;pz&gt; &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt; &lt;frames&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Moves the camera to a new location (specified as in &quot;goto&quot;).
 The transition occurs over &lt;frames&gt; frames.
</p>

Common Questions (FAQ)
<p>
Q: I am only getting a few frames-per-second. This sucks! What
 gives? 
</p>
<p>
A1: You're probably running Mesa in software mode. You should
 read the &quot;README.3Dfx&quot; file in the Mesa distro. Specifically,
 you need to &quot;setenv MESA_GLX_FX fullscreen&quot;.
</p>
<p>
A2: You don't have a 3D graphics card. Go buy one (see below)!
</p>
<p>
Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just dumps core. That's not as much
 fun as 3D Pacman, now is it?
</p>
<p>
A1: If you are using a 3Dfx card, make sure you are running xmame.xgl
 as root. Root privileges are required to access the 3Dfx hardware.
</p>
<p>
A2: If you're using Mesa and haven't upgraded to v3.0, do so.
 
</p>
<p>
Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just hangs at the initial game screen.
</p>
<p>
A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard
 input under KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers.
</p>
<p>
Q: Which graphics cards are usable with xmame.xgl? 
</p>
<p>
A: We have the following experiences (date 20010327):
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Vodoo3 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2), with command line
 options &quot;-noglaa&quot; and 16bpp X11 server color depth.
 <item>
GeForce + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 with default command
 line options and 16/24bpp X11 server color depth.
 <item>
NVIDIA TNT2 + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 with command
 line options &quot;-bpp 16&quot; and 16bpp (may be 24bpp also ???)
 X11 server color depth (OpenGL colortable mapping is buggy).
 <item>
NVIDIA TNT + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 with command
 line options &quot;-bpp 16&quot; and 16bpp (may be 24bpp also ???)
 X11 server color depth (OpenGL colortable mapping is buggy).
 <item>
Matrox MGA 400 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2) with command
 line options &quot;-bpp 16&quot;, &quot;-noglaa&quot; (???) and 16bpp
 (may be 24bpp also ???) X11 server color depth (OpenGL colortable
 mapping is buggy).
</itemize>
</p><p>
All of the above drivers work with the option &quot;-bpp 16&quot;
 and/or &quot;-noglext78&quot;, the latter of which is very slow,
 of course! So it looks like an OpenGL implementation bug is causing
 these driver/hardware combinations to only work with these command
 line options. The bug may lie within these OpenGL functions:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
glColorTableEXT 
 <item>
glColorSubTableEXT
</itemize>
</p><p>
Currently fast and funny driver/hardware combinations are:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
NVIDIA GeForce + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2; I have
 tested the GeForce256 (AGP) hardware. 
 <item>
Vodoo + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2); I have tested the
 Vodoo3 hardware.
</itemize>
</p><p>
Q: When I run xmame.xgl, everything is messed up.
</p>
<p>
A: Read the above experiences ... and try
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
switching your X server's bpp value, e.g. switch from 32bpp or
 24bpp to 16bpp; 
 <item>
the command line option &quot;-bpp 16&quot;;
 <item>
the command line option &quot;-noglaa&quot;;
 <item>
the command line option &quot;-noglext&quot;.
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Present Limitations/Bugs
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
No clipping of vector games (most noticeable in cabinet mode).
 <item>
No preservation of game aspect ratio in cabinet mode.
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Future Work
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Fixing existing bugs .. are there any ? Or are there some unknown
 features only ;-) ? 
 <item>
Optimize the drawing code to update only the changed portions
 of the game bitmap. Optimizing the dirty code ..

Xmame Mailing List 
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
The xmame mailing list is intended to be a technical forum for
 xmame developers, that is,
 <itemize>
  <item>
To exchange ideas for producing a better xmame.
  <item>
To share patches and bug notifications.
  <item>
To study new design strategies.
  <item>
To expose problems and learn know-how.
 </itemize>
 <item>
The Xmame mailing list <bf>is not</bf> a forum about playing games (but
 everyone on the list plays...); so please
 <itemize>
  <item>
<bf>Don't use the list to ask about ROMs.</bf>
  <item>
<bf>Don't ask about non-UNIX ports of MAME, just about MAME and xmame.
</bf>
  <item>
<bf>Don't ask about implementing a game. Just search the docs and
 contribute yourself (you'll enjoy twice: programming and playing...).
</bf>
  <item>
<bf>Don't show your last high score in xxx game (we are interested
 in programming, and then playing, in this order).</bf>
 </itemize>
 <item>
<bf>Copyright notice: NEVER, I repeat NEVER send ROM images to the
  list.</bf> (But you can tell us where to retrieve them... ;-) )
 <item>
At this moment, the xmame list is <bf>unmoderated</bf>; that is, everyone
 subscribed will receive everything sent to the list. We foresee no
 need to change this policy.
</itemize>
</p><p>
If you want to send a personal mail to the xmame/xmess coordinator,
 send to the address below. Everyone who contributes to xmame/xmess
 should subscribe to the xmame/xmess mailing list.
