Compiling, Setting Up and Starting xmame/xmess
<p>
Note: This section is not a Unix tutorial. You need to know some basic
  Unix commands to compile and install xmame/xmess.
</p>
<sect1>
Requirements     
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
GNU make is MANDATORY in ALL Systems, even if you use a different  compiler.
 
 <item>
On all platforms zlib is now needed since the core uses it, if you don't
 have zlib a stripped version is included with xmame see: <ref id="FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?" name="FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not while compiling?" > and <ref id="FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?" name="FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?" >
 <item>
You are encouraged to use GNU development environment gcc, gmake gnu- ar.
 Lots of problems found due to the very permissive syntax in gcc, so if you
 use a strictly ANSI C compiler, you'll get lots of warnings, and if the version
 of xmame/xmess is not fully debugged, compilation errors.
 <item>
Xmame compilation breaks when using egcs-1.1.x or gcc-2.95, use <tt>-fno-strict-aliasing</tt>
 to fix it. gcc-2.95.1 does work with <tt>-fstrict-aliasing</tt>, and gives a nice speed
 increase.
</itemize>
</p><sect1>
Follow these steps to compile xmame/xmess
<p>
<enum>
 <item>
See <ref id="Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems" name="Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems" > for platform specific compiling information.
 <item>
See <ref id="Display subsystem specific comments and notes" name="Display subsystem specific comments and notes" > for special display methods information.
 <item>
Download the xmame/xmess source files archive.
 <item>
Move the xmame/xmess source files archive to a suitable work directory.
 When you extract the archive, sub directories will be created under the  work
 directory.
 <item>
Rename the source files archive so its extension is .gz, so that gzip doesn't
 complain. For example, change <tt>xmame-0.34b1.1.tgz</tt> to <tt>xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz
</tt>
 <item>
Use gzip -d to uncompress the archive. For example, type:
 <verb>
gzip -d xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz
 </verb>
 <item>
Extract the files with tar. For example, type:
 <verb>
tar xvf xmame-0.34b1.1.tar
 </verb>
 <item>
After extracting the archive, change to the subdirectory created by  the
 extraction process. For example, after extracting the xmame- 0.34b1.1.tar archive,
 a directory named <tt>xmame-0.34b1.1</tt> is created. Change to it. This directory is
 the top of the source tree.
 <item>
Copy makefile.unix to Makefile, the distributed Makefile is used for development
 and is not a good starting point!
 <item>
Edit the <tt>Makefile</tt> and change the settings according to your system. The
 default <tt>makefile.unix</tt> is pre configured to run under X11/Linux. Be careful
 editing this file.
 <itemize>
  <item>
If you intend to compile in X11 joystick support, type the following to
 see the available Xdevice list:
  <verb>
make xlistdev; ./xlistdev
  </verb>
  <item>
Choose the desired device and re-edit Makefile, setting the option X11_JOYNAME
 to the correct device.
 </itemize>
 <item>
Compile xmame/xmess by typing:
 <verb>
make
 </verb>
 <item>
If the compile fails, report the problem to the author.
 <item>
<bf>*** YOU MAY NEED TO BE root TO PERFORM THIS STEP ***</bf> To install xmame/xmess,
 type:
 <verb>
make install
 </verb>
 <item>
If you want you can now build xmame / xmess for another target / display-method,
 otherwise skip to the next step.
 <enum>
  <item>
If you want to also build for another target repeat repeat the <tt>"make"</tt> and
 <tt>"make install"</tt> steps adding <tt>"TARGET=&lt;target&gt;"</tt> to the make command for example:
  <verb>
make TARGET=mess
make install
  </verb>
  <item>
If you want to also build for another display method repeat the <tt>"make"</tt> and
 <tt>"make install"</tt> steps adding <tt>"DISPLAY_METHOD=&lt;method&gt;"</tt> to the make command
 for example:
  <verb>
make DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install
  </verb>
  <item>
You can also combine the 2 above for example:
  <verb>
make TARGET=mess DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
make install
  </verb>
 </enum>
 <item>
In your home directory, create a subdirectory called .xmame.
 <item>
From the top of the source tree, copy the file doc/xmamerc.dist to the
 &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/ directory. (For xmess do this for xmessrc)
 <item>
If desired copy xmamerc.dist to the global xmamerc location as &quot;xmamerc&quot;
 (For mess copy xmamerc.dist to xmessrc). The global xmamerc location is defined
 in the Makefile.
 <item>
Edit &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/xmamerc to match your preferences.
 (For xmess edit &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/xmessrc)
 <item>
Be sure that DISPLAY and PATH enviromment variables are  set correctly.
 <item>
Make sure your ROM images are installed.
 <item>
Start X-Windows. (Unless you compiled for a different display method in
 which case you skip this step.)
 <item>
Start xmame/xmess. For example:
 <verb>
/usr/games/xmame.x11 dkong
 </verb>
</enum>

 PROMs, see <ref id="FAQ: Why doesn't a game work?" name="FAQ: Why doesn't a game work?" > and <ref id="FAQ: What are PROMs?" name="FAQ: What are PROMs?" >
 <item>
Is the program in your PATH?
 <item>
The svgalib/xf86_dga build of xmame/xmess requires setuid root. Are your
 permissions correct?
 <item>
Try asking the friendly folks at the newsgroup alt.game.mame to see if
 anyone else has experienced the same problem as you.
 <item>
Try mailing to the xmame mailinglist, see <ref id="Mail" name="Mail" > for more information.

<sect1>
Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems <label id="Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems" >
<sect2>
Linux i386
<p>
Linux i386 is the platform I (Hans) use, so xmame should compile without
 any hassles on Linux i386.
</p>
<p>
Some bugs have been found and worked around when using gcc27x, please use
 egcs if available. If more gcc bugs popup egcs will be  made mandatory, but
 I hope that won't be nescesarry.
</p>
<p>
It has been reported that some SoundBlaster AWE32 cards do not  correctly
 manage get_freespace(). If so you'll get some audio_ioctl() calls failed messages
 in console, and if everything goes right a message that xmame/xmess is falling
 back to timer based audio. If  this doesn't happen and sound isn't right try
 forcing timer based  audio by starting xmame/xmess with <tt>-timer</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Sb64/128pci cards (ensoniq 137x based cards) also do not correctly manage
 get_freespace(), unfortunatly this doesn't result in failed ioctl's instead
 they just ignore the calls. Xmame tries to autodetect this and to fall back
 to timer based audio. If this doesn't happen and sound isn't right try forcing
 timer based audio by starting xmame/xmess with <tt>-timer</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Also, I've tested sound using the PC-Speaker driver module. It  works!!
 But needs <tt>-timer</tt>, again it should do this  automagicly, but you know what todo
 if it doesn't.
</p>
<p>
Distribution Specific Comments:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
S.u.S.E. Linux: Besides the gcc compiler and libc  libraries, which are
 both from the &quot;d&quot; series, other packages  need to be installed or
 the build will fail. If compiling for svgalib, the svgalib package from series
 &quot;d&quot; installed. If compiling for X-Windows, you must have xdevel package
 from series &quot;x&quot; installed. These packages can be installed using
 the &quot;yast&quot; utility included in the S.u.S.E. distribution.
 <item>
Red Hat Linux is the operating system used by the author. xmame/xmess 
 should build correctly under Red Hat Linux. :-)
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Linux powerpc
<p>
Linux powerpc should work from now on, here's an email from: Andreas Varga
 <tt><url url="mailto:sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at" name="sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at"></tt>, the linux/powerpc maintainer describing the nescesarry steps:
</p>
<p>
Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on Linux/PowerPC with SVGALIB
</p>
<p>
Makefile:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc 
 <item>
enable DISPLAY_METHOD = svgalib 
 <item>
enable ARCH = linux 
 <item>
remove -lvgagl from LIBS.svgalib in src/unix/unix.mak(only -lvga is required)
</itemize>
</p><p>
Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on Linux/PowerPC with X11 
</p>
<p>
Makefile: 
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc 
 <item>
enable DISPLAY_METHOD = x11 
 <item>
enable ARCH = linux 
</itemize>
</p><p>
Another thing... sound is not working, because sound drivers support is
 currently under development in Linux/PPC kernels...there is an old driver that
 is a hacked Soundblaster driver, and newer 2.1.1xx kernels have a sound drivers
 based on Amiga DMA sound drivers... Once this issues are settled there should
 be a full OSS-compatible driver... sound should work then...
</p>
<p>
I can't speak about Joystick support...
</p>
<p>
The original Linux/PPC target changes in the Makefile were done by me,
 but there are some other changes required to get it to compile... Starting
 from October I will have some more time to work on this, and I'll keep you
 updated...
</p>
<p>
Cheers, Andreas
</p>
<sect2>
IRIX
<p>
Use the generic unix arch for those machines that have no  sound support
 installed. ( xmame/xmess uses the dmedia package or the newer AL package on
 IRIX systems )
</p>
<p>
Silicon Graphics provides several native compilers. xmame/xmess has  been
 compiled and tested with the normal cc. There were some problems with this
 when using -n32 for new style 32bit code. It does work when using -o32 for
 oldstyle 32 bit code. It should now also work with -n32 wich is much faster.
</p>
<p>
The use of DCC is not recommended (anymore) since it's a c++  compiler
 and thus won't even compile xmame/xmess out of the box due to uncasted malloc's.
 Changing all these malloc's would be crazy, esp since they are not only in
 the osd part, but also in the core which is not under our control. Besides
 that mame is normal c, so please compile it with a normal c compiler.
</p>
<p>
Some problems have been reported using GNU linker. It's recommended that
 you use native one.
</p>
<sect2>
HPUX
<p>
Use the generic unix arch. In HP-UX gcc and gnu-make is MANDATORY.
</p>
<sect2>
ULTRIX 
<p>
Use the generic unix arch.
</p>
<p>
Notes received from Danny <tt><url url="mailto:dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es" name="dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es"></tt>
</p>
<p>
<bf>VERY IMPORTANT!!!</bf>
</p>
<p>
The xmame/xmess CPU emulators access memory through pointers which are
 sometimes cast to illegal addresses - as far as the MIPS CPU is concerned.
 The Ultrix operating system is aware of that and fixes this &quot;unaligned
 data access&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Depending on your system setup, lots of warnings are generated for certain
 games. Fortunately these messages can be disabled by  executing the command
 &quot;uac p 0&quot; in the same shell where xmame/xmess  will be running.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: The new <tt>-DALIGN_INTS</tt> switch in the makefile fixes these unaligned
 accesses in the source which is probably a lot faster than hot fixing them
 in the kernel segfault handler.
</p>
<p>
Use gnu make.
</p>
<p>
Compile with the `c89' compiler. Though `gcc' has no problems  with compiling
 and optimizing xmame/xmess, the resulting `c89'  executable is faster on an
 empty machine (read: xmame can use all  cpu &amp; memory without competing
 with other high priority  processes), so you can set `frameskip' to 1.
</p>
<p>
When compiling with `c89 -O2' don't forget to also use `-Olimit  1000'.
 If 1000 is not enough, the compiler will tell you to  increase it.
</p>
<sect2>
SunOS &amp; Solaris
<p>
There are 2 relevant architecture options available in the makefile: 
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    ARCH = generic : use this for old SunOs running on Sparcs,
                     but a Sparc running Solaris will usually
                     handle this option too.
    ARCH = solaris : this is the one you should use for Sparcs
                     running Solaris.        
</verb>
</p><p>
Currently sound is not supported under sunos. The solaris arch does support
 audio.
</p>
<p>
If you are using Sun's OpenWindows implementation of X11, then make sure
 that the X11INC and X11LIB variables in the X11 Options section of the makefile
 are set properly. (There are already entries for the standard OpenWin directory
 there that you can uncomment).
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you are compiling for X11 then you need to set these variables
 properly, no matter what implementation of X11 you are using!  :)
</p>
<p>
If you are using Sun's SunPro cc compiler, then the following optimisation
 flags have been reported to be good:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    OPTFLAGS    = -fast -xO4 -native
</verb>
</p><p>
Finally, there has been a case of the xmame compilation processes breaking
 over the &quot;ar&quot; program. Most Solaris installations will include a
 set of utilities that conform to the XPG4 standard, usually in the &quot;/usr/xpg4/bin&quot;
 directory. The XPG4 version of &quot;ar&quot; should be avoided like the plague.
 Ensure that the &quot;/usr/ccs/bin&quot; appears in your path before the &quot;/usr/xpg4/bin&quot;
 directory and everything should go smoothly.
</p>
<p>
PLEASE NOTE : there is currently not much support for SunOS/Solaris. If
 you have any trouble, try to fix it yourself. If you succeed, send a message
 to the mailing list detailing what you did. If you don't succeed, send a message
 anyway and someone _may_ be able to help you. Either way, this is the only
 way that problems with xmame on SunOS/Solaris will get fixed.
</p>
<sect2>
Openstep
<p>
You must use the OpenStep gnumake, not make. You must also use the NeXT/Apple
 cc rather than gcc. Also use only the optimisation options as recommended for
 OpenStep in the makefile, others will cause the resulting executable to crash.
 The OpenStep assembler on i386 architectures is incompatible with the mame
 assembler cpu cores and thus you must use the C versions (Use i386-noasm instead
 of i386 when compiling for i386).
</p>
<p>
The supplied complier is based on gcc 2.7.2.1 which will not compile src/profiler.c
 without crashing. To get around this you must turn off + optimisation when
 this crash occurs, re-make to compile this file only, then stop the make, re-enable
 optimisation and continue.
</p>
<p>
On an OpenStep keyboard the functions keys do not all operate as expected.
 Using the command key in conjuction with a number key generates the equivalent
 function key within xmame, with 0, - and = + representing F10, F11 and F12
 resepectively. Also note that the ALT + keys cannot be mapped. As most games
 tend to use this as the default fire button it is exteremly useful to remap
 this globally the first time you run xmame.
</p>

Xmame frequently asked questions<label id="Xmame frequently asked questions" >
<sect1>
What is mame?
<p>
Mame is a arcade machine emulator. Started in 1997, by Nicola  Salmoria,
 mame started out as a series of emulators for  individual games. This series
 of emulators was combined into a  multiple game emulator format. This is the
 current form of mame, no longer a one man show, there are over 100 contributors
 to the project.
</p>
<p>
Mame was created by Nicola Salmoria.
</p>
<p>
Also see <url url="readme.mame" name="the official mame readme file (readme.mame)">
</p>
<sect1>
What is mess?
<p>
Mess is just like mame a virtual machine emulator, only it doesn't emulate
 arcade machines but other computers and consoles.
</p>
<p>
Also see <url url="readme.mess" name="the official mess readme file (readme.mess)">
</p>
<sect1>
What is xmame/xmess?
<p>
Xmame/xmess are the Unix/X11 ports of the mame and mess projects. It makes
 mame/mess available on *ix machines using the X11R6 X-Window system (and SVGAlib/ggi/XF86-DGA
 too).
</p>
<p>
Mame was orginally ported by Allard Van Der Bas, Dick the Ridder and Juan
 Antonio Marmnez.
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess is currently maintained by Hans de Goede.
</p>
<sect1>
What are the differences between mame/mess and xmame/xmess?
<p>
None significant.
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess is based on the mame/mess source code. Due to technical reasons
 beyond the scope of this document, the mame/mess source may not compile under
 Unix. That why the xmame/xmess project exists. Each time mame/mess is updated,
 the code is tested  (and patched if needed) under Unix. This way xmame/xmess
 releases are always the same as their mame counterparts.
</p>
<p>
There are no plans for the independent development of xmame/xmess.
</p>
<sect1>
What hardware and operating systems are supported?     
<p>
Xmame runs on both little endian and big endian CPU's, using aligned integer
 access if needed and is compatible with 64 bit CPU's. The current list of supported
 CPU's in the makefile is:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
i386 + gnu-asm
 <item>
i386 no asm
 <item>
alpha
 <item>
ia64 (merced)
 <item>
m68k
 <item>
generic risc (powerpc, sparc, hppa, ibm)
 <item>
generic risc, lsb-first (RISC (ultrix machines))
 <item>
mips (generic risc + SGI compiler bug workarounds)
</itemize>
</p><p>
Adding support for another cpu (if nescesarry) should be trivial.
</p>
<p>
The following Unix platform's are specificly supported:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Linux
 <item>
FreeBSD
 <item>
NetBSD
 <item>
Solaris (SunOS)
 <item>
OpenStep (noasm only on i386)
 <item>
IRIX with sound using the dmedia package or the new al package (sound currently
 broken)
 <item>
AIX (sound currently broken)
 <item>
generic unix, no sound
</itemize>
</p><p>
The generic unix entry should work for any reasonable standard Unix variant,
 but lacks sound since there is no single Unix sound standard.
</p>
<p>
On all platforms zlib is now needed since the core uses it, if you don't
 have zlib use the included one by uncommenting the appropriate line in Makefile.
</p>
<p>
The following display methods are supported, X11 is the only one which
 works on all platforms, except for OpenStep which only work with Openstep bitmaps:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
X11 (X-windows)
 <item>
svgalib
 <item>
GGI (Generic Graphics Interface)
 <item>
OpenGL using X11 for input
 <item>
glide using X11 for input (3DFX)
 <item>
glide using svgalib for input (3DFX)
 <item>
OpenStep bitmaps
 <item>
SDL (Simple Direct Medialayer)
</itemize>
</p><p>
The following is a list of arch/os/display combinations, with maintainers,
 for arch/os/display combinations which are activly supported. Please mail the
 maintainer of the arch/os/display combination for compilation and other arch/os/display
 specific problems. Mail Hans <tt><url url="mailto:hans@highrise.nl" name="hans@highrise.nl"></tt> for generic (e.g. x11) problems.

<p>
We are always looking for people willing to test and answer questions about
 xmame on a new arch/os/display. This takes very little work and could help
 other people tremendously. If you're interested mail Hans <tt><url url="mailto:hans@highrise.nl" name="hans@highrise.nl"></tt>.
</p>
<sect1>
My system is supported but xmame/xmess give me errors and fails. Why?
<p>
Xmame/xmess should run on 8bpp Pseudo Color displays and on 16, 24 and
 32bpp True Color displays. If your X-Server does not support any  of these
 display types, xmame/xmess will not run.
</p>
<p>
You can verify your X-Server support by starting your X-Server  and running
 the xdpyinfo program. See the xdpyinfo manual page  for more information.
</p>
<sect1>
What is the role of the xmamerc/xmessrc file?
<p>
A normal xmame/xmess invocation looks like:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    xmame pacman -sound -nojoy -frameskip 2 -heightscale 3 &bsol;   
        -widthscale 2
</verb>
</p><p>
Most of the time, you will want to use the same configuration for  each
 game. Xmame/xmess will read this file for default values for the  parameters
 that you can set. This way the only parameters you  need to express on the
 command line are the ones you want to  override.
</p>
<p>
Another reason for xmamerc/xmessrc is keyboard remapping. Some Unix  keyboards
 are very different than their PC counterparts. To  compensate for the changes,
 xmame/xmess allows you to remap keys that  are not available on Unix keyboards
 to keys that are available.
</p>
<sect1>
What is the syntax of the xmamerc/xmessrc file.
<p>
The syntax is quite simple:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
   &quot;keyword value&quot;
</verb>
</p><p>
See <url url="xmamerc.dist" name="xmamerc.dist"> for most keywords. Allmost all commandline options can be used as
 keywords (without the -), use value 0 or 1 for commandline options which have
 a negating (-no&lsqb;option&rsqb;) counterpart. As usual lines begining with
 &quot;&num;&quot; are comments.
</p>
<p>
You can also generate a configfile with all the current settings to use
 as a template by typing:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
   xmame -showconfig &gt; &tilde;/.xmame/xmamerc
</verb>
</p><sect1>
Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc go? <label id="FAQ: Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc go?" >
<sect2>
Roms/Samples
<p>
Xmame/xmess uses a &quot;:&quot; seperated rompath to find out which dirs
 to search for roms/samples.
</p>
<p>
The default rompath is XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile during compile.
</p>
<p>
This is overwritten by any rompath in xmamerc/xmessrc. Which can be overwritten
 again with the -rompath commandline option.
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess searches every dir in this path for roms/samples in the following
 way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename.zip             (containing filename.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.ext
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.ext.gz (containing filename.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.zip    (containing filename.ext)
</verb>
</p><p>
So lets say that we are searching for rom0001.1 which is part of pacman
 then xmame/xmess would search every dir in your rompath for:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman.zip               (containing rom0001.1)
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.1
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.1.gz      (containing rom0001.1)
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.zip       (containing rom0001.1)
</verb>
</p><p>
Note: If your neogeo games can't find neogeo.rom put it in a dir called
 neogeo somewhere in your rompath, or put it in neogeo.zip somewhere in your
 rompath.
</p>
<sect2>
Read/write Diskette Images
<p>
This section only applies to xmess emulations which support read/write
 diskette images and thus try to open the image read/write.
</p>
<p>
Xmess first searches for read/write images with the name specified on the
 commandline:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext
</verb>
</p><p>
Where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline, this
 way absoulte and relative filenames can be used directly on the commandline
 for an image which is not in the rompath.
</p>
<p>
Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for roms/samples in the following
 way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext
</verb>
</p><p>
Note that (g)zipped images are not supported for r/w images.
</p>
<sect2>
Rom Cartridges/Read Only Diskette Images
<p>
Xmess begins by searching for cartdriges/disks from the current dir in
 the following way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext.gz            (containing image.ext)
    &lt;path&gt;/image.zip               (containing image.ext)
</verb>
</p><p>
Where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline, this
 way absoulte and relative filenames can be used directly on the commandline
 for an image which is not in the rompath.
</p>
<p>
Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for carts/images in the following
 way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext.gz             (containing image.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.zip                (containing image.ext)
</verb>
</p><p>
Finally xmess searches the rompath as desribed above using the systemtype
 for gamename.
</p>
<p>
So letts say we want to play mario.nes on the nes emulation of xmess. We
 would then type: &quot;xmess nes mario.nes&quot;. Xmess then begins by searching
 the current dir for:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    mario.nes
    mario.nes.gz                   (containing mario.nes)
    mario.zip                      (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
After that xmess searches each dir in your rompath for:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.nes
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.nes.gz             (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.zip                (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
And finally xmess searches each dir in your rompath for:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes.zip                  (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.nes
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.nes.gz         (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.zip            (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
Since xmess first searches for cartridges/disks from the current dir you
 can also specify cartridges/disks not in your rompath for example:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &quot;xmess nes ../mario.nes&quot;
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmess then searches for:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    ../mario.nes
    ../mario.nes.gz                (containing mario.nes)
    ../mario.zip                   (containing mario.nes)
</verb>
</p><p>
And will also search the rompath as described above with ../mario.nes as
 image name but this is not that usefull.
</p>
<sect2>
Artwork
<p>
Xmame/xmess searches every dir in the rompath for artwork in the following
 way:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.png.gz           (containing artwork.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.zip              (containing artwork.png)
</verb>
</p><p>
Then xmame/xmess searches the rompath as in roms/samples.
</p>
<p>
So lets say we want to play foo which uses bar.png. Xmame/xmess then begins
 searching each dir in your rompath for:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.png.gz               (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.zip                  (containing bar.png)
</verb>
</p><p>
And then xmame/xmess searches each dir in your rompath for:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo.zip                  (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.png.gz           (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.zip              (containing bar.png)
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Xmame configuration
<p>
Xmame looks for the following configuration files and parses each one found,
 later parsed files can overwrite options in previously parsed files:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    XMAMEROOT/xmamerc
    XMAMEROOT/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/xmamerc
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/rc/&lt;gamename&gt;rc
</verb>
</p><p>
<tt>XMAMEROOT</tt> is defined during compile time, see Makefile.
</p>
<p>
<tt>DISPLAY_METHOD</tt> is the <tt>DISPLAY_METHOD</tt> for which xmame was compiled, this
 can be one of: x11, svgalib, ggi, xgl, xfx, svgafx, openstep, SDL.
</p>
<p>
For xmess of course replace xmame by xmess ;)
</p>
<sect2>
Game configuration
<p>
Game configuration files are kept on a per user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/cfg/&lt;game&gt;.cfg resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/cfg/&lt;game&gt;.cfg
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Game state
<p>
Game state files are kept on a per user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/sta/&lt;game&gt;.sta resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/sta/&lt;game&gt;.sta
</verb>
</p><sect2>
NVram
<p>
NVram files are kept on a per user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/nvram/&lt;game&gt;.nv resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/nvram/&lt;game&gt;.nv
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Mem cards
<p>
Mem cards files are kept on a per user base in:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame/mem/&lt;filename&gt;.mem resp
    &dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess/mem/&lt;filename&gt;.mem
</verb>
</p><p>
Where &lt;filename&gt; is given by the game-driver. 
</p>
<sect2>
Screenshots
<p>
Screenshots which can be made pry pressing F12 are saved as png files in
 the directory from where xmame is started (cwd).
</p>
<p>
This can be overidden by the screenshotdir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc. Which
 can again be overidden by the <tt>-screenshotdir</tt> cmdline-option.
</p>
<p>
They are saved as:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &lt;screenshotdir&gt;/&lt;game&gt;xxxx.png
    Where xxxx is a number.
</verb>
</p><sect2>
Highscore's
<p>
Hi-scores are stored in XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile when building.
 This can be overidden by the spooldir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc. Which can again
 be overidden by the <tt>-spooldir</tt> cmdline-option.
</p>
<p>
So only give a 
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    drwxrwsr-x root games &lt;spooldir&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
permission and setgid xmame/xmess to &quot;games&quot; to get it to work.
 Note this doesn't work with suid root versions (svgalib &amp; XF86-DGA), suggestions
 welcome.
</p>
<p>
For know use <tt>&dollar;&lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmame</tt> or <tt>&dollar; &lcub;HOME&rcub;/.xmess</tt>
 as spooldir in xmamerc/xmessrc for  suid root versions.
</p>
<p>
Note for highscores to work, xmame must also be able to find hiscore.dat
</p>
<sect2>
hiscore.dat
<p>
If you want to use highscores mame needs to load hiscore.dat to get highscore
 info.
</p>
<p>
The default is <tt>XMAMEROOT</tt>hiscore.dat/. XMAMEROOT is set during compile-time,
 see the Makefile. This can be overriden by the hiscorefile entry in xmamerc
 if present, which can again be overiden by the cmdline-option <tt>-hiscorefile</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>hiscore.dat</tt> is available from the mame webpage: <url url="http://www.mame.net" name="http://www.mame.net">
</p>
<sect2>
cheat.dat
<p>
If you want to use cheats mame needs to load cheat.dat to get cheat info.
</p>
<p>
The default is XMAMEROOT/cheat.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during compile-time,
 see Makefile. This can be overriden by the cheatfile entry in xmamerc if present,
 which can again be overiden by the cmdline-option <tt>-cheatfile</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>cheat.dat</tt> is available from the mame webpage: <url url="http://www.mame.net" name="http://www.mame.net">
</p>
<sect2>
history.dat
<p>
If you want to display some nice background info on games mame needs to
 load history.dat.
</p>
<p>
The default is XMAMEROOT/history.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during compile-time,
 see Makefile. This can be overriden by the historyfile entry in xmamerc if
 present, which can again be overiden by the cmdline-option <tt>-historyfile</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<tt>history.dat</tt> is available from the mame webpage: <url url="http://www.mame.net" name="http://www.mame.net">

<sect2>
Input logs
<p>
Input logs are saved / read under the name specified after the <tt>-record
 / -playback</tt> option, this name is relative to the current path.
</p>
<sect2>
Xmame/xmess still can't find file's / store highscore's
<p>
Type <tt>&quot;xmame/xmess -showconfig | more&quot;</tt> and check that the rompath
 and spooldir showed are correct and readable/writable. Otherwise recheck xmamerc/xmessrc.
 Remember that xmess also searches the current dir.
</p>
<sect1>
How do I start xmess/xmame ?
<p>
To start xmame type:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    xmame &lsqb;options&rsqb; &lt;gamename&gt; &lsqb;more options&rsqb;
</verb>
</p><p>
For xmess type: 
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    xmess &lsqb;options&rsqb; &lt;systemname&gt; &lsqb;more options&rsqb; &bsol;
    &lt;disk/romimage(s)&gt; &lsqb;more options&rsqb;
</verb>
</p><p>
All options are optional ;)
</p>
<p>
Xmame/xmess supports most dos commandline-options (see readme.mame / readme.mess)
 as well as a few of its own, type xmame -help |  more for a  complete list.
</p>
<p>
With xmess some systems don't require a disk/romimage, but most do.
</p>
<sect1>
What are the command line parameters for xmame/xmess?
<p>
To see a list of available parameters, type:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    /usr/games/xmame -help | more
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmame/xmess supports most of the command line parameters as the DOS  version
 as well a some of its own.
</p>
<p>
See the file readme.mame / readme.mess for more information about the command
 line parameters.
</p>
<sect1>
What keys does xmame/xmess use?
<p>
Xmame/xmess uses the same key-bindings as the DOS version of mame: The
 following keys work in all emulators:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    `  or &tilde;      Enter On screen display to change volume, brightness etc.
    Tab          Enter configuration menu. Press Tab or Esc to get back to
                 the emulation.
    P            Pause
    F3           Reset
    F4           Show the game graphics. Use cursor keys to change set/color,
                 F4 or Esc to return to the emulation.
    F8           Reduce frame skip
    F9           Increase frameskip
    F10          Toggle speed throttling
    F10 + shift  Toggle idle sleeping
    F11          Toggle speed display
    F11 + shift  Toggle profiler display
    F12          Save a screen snapshot.
    ESC          Exit emulator
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmame has 2 different auto frameskipping algorithms, these can be selected
 with the -frameskipper option. And with key combis:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Key combi:             Gives you the:
    left-ctrl + insert     standard dos frameskipper
    left-ctrl + home       William Barath's frameskipper
</verb>
</p><p>
Xmames display scaling can be controlled on the fly with the following
 key combis:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Key combi:             Result:
    left-shift + insert    Increase widthscale
    left-shift + delete    Decrease widthscale
    left-shift + home      Increase heightscale
    left-shift + end       Decrease heightscale
    left-shift + pageup    Increase scale
    left-shift + pagedown  Decrease scale
</verb>
</p><p>
Under X11 xmame can switch to and from different modes runtime: 
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Key combi:             Warps you to:
    left-alt + insert      Normal window
    left-alt + home        DGA fullscreen mode
</verb>
</p><p>
Under X11 in a window you can also grab the mouse to be able to play with
 the mouse, press left-alt + page-down to grab the mouse, press it again to
 release it.
</p>
<sect1>
Why doesn't a game have sound?
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
First check that sound is working in other applications.
 <item>
Check that sound is supported for the game that has no sound,  not all
 games have sound:
 <item>
For xmame take a look at gamelist.mame, is the sound for the game emulated?
 <item>
For xmess take a look at readme.mess is the sound for the system emulated?
 <item>
Check the operating system support chart in the earlier part of  this file,
 does xmame/xmess support sound on your system?
</itemize>
</p><sect1>
My sound seems lagged? / My sound Clicks? / What does -bufsize do?
<p>
With the <tt>-bufsize</tt> commandline option / the bufsize configfile keyword you
 can specify the number of frames of audio to buffer. The default is 2 frames.
</p>
<p>
This value should be ok for everyone, but if you still have problems read
 on.
</p>
<p>
If the buffersize is to small, this causes the buffer to get empty between
 frames which in turn causes clicks/pauses in the sound. If this is the case
 highering the -bufsize value to for example 2.5 should help.
</p>
<p>
If however you make the buffersize to large, then so much audio becomes
 buffered, that the sound could become lagged. E.g. you would here the coin
 drop sound 0.5 seconds after pressing the insert coin key. In this case lower
 the bufsize to for example 1.5 .
</p>
<p>
Please lett me know if you need to change this setting, since I'm planning
 on removing it in a future release.
</p>

Why doesn't a game work? <label id="FAQ: Why doesn't a game work?" >
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Do you have the right roms or did you get checksum failures?
 <item>
Xmame version 0.34 and higher require PROM files that were not included
 in ROM images released before version 0.34. See the question on PROMs  below
 for more information.
 <item>
For xmame check the file gamelist.mame to see if the game is playable,
 just because a game is included doesn't mean it is working yet.
 <item>
For xmess take a look at readme.mess maybe the system isn't emulated all
 that good yet.
 <item>
Some games require sound support. If you don't have sound  support under
 your Unix or sound isn't supported by xmame/xmess under  your Unix, try the
 <tt>-fakesound</tt> command line parameter.

What are PROMs? <label id="FAQ: What are PROMs?" >
<p>
PROMs contain game specific information that used to be built in  to mame
 in versions prior to 0.34. This information has been  extracted and is now
 included with new versions of ROM files for  games that require this information.
</p>
<p>
If you want to use your current ROM files, you can obtain just the PROM
 images in one large file at:

Why is xmame/xmess slow?
<p>
xmame/xmess is a compiled C program that is emulating hardware.  Software
 emulation of hardware always pays a speed penalty. Here  are some things you
 can do:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Try using the -frameskip command line parameter.
 <item>
Try pressing F8 while running xmame/xmess to alter the frame rate.
 <item>
Try disabling the throttle with the -nothrottle command line  parameter
 or by pressing F10 while running xmame/xmess.
 <item>
While running xmame/xmess, press F11 to check the speed of xmame/xmess.
  If you never get a display of 100&percnt;, you need a faster computer.
</itemize>
</p><p>
You can also try recompiling xmame/xmess with more optimal settings, the
 following suggestions may not work or may not be appropriate on some machines
 and in some installations.  However, in cases where they do work, there can
 be a noticeable increase in overall performance of xmame/xmess.
</p>
<p>
These &quot;enhancements&quot; simply require editing the Makefile that
 is distributed with xMame, and then recompiling the source.  If you are compiling
 the source for the second time you will need to do:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    make clean
    make
    make install
</verb>
</p><p>
after editing the Makefile to set your new settings.
</p>
<sect2>
SPEEDUP &num; 1 - Inline compiling
<p>
Try enabling inline compiling by commenting and uncommenting the following
 lines:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &num; IL    = '-DINLINE=static inline'
    IL     = -DINLINE=static
</verb>
</p><sect2>
SPEEDUP &num; 2 - Direct Graphics Access
<p>
For a big boost try enabling DGA by uncommenting the following line:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    DGA = 1
</verb>
</p><p>
Then start xmame as root, and press left-alt + home to switch to dga mode,
 that should be a lot faster, and doesn't need / use xsync ;) 
</p>
<p>
To get back to a window without exiting press left-alt + insert.
</p>
<p>
The benefit of DGA is that it is Direct Graphics Access and as such writes
 directly to the framebuffer (Think directx versus GDI under windows). So it
 should be a tad faster, unless you've got a really really well accelerated
 X-server, which could be just as fast. Try pressing F11 to see the actual framerate,
 although it might be hardly noticable (visually atleast), it should give you
 some speed increase.
</p>
<p>
Besides that it automaticly switches to the right mode and removes any
 window manager stuff, but that can be done without DGA too (I might at such
 a feature later, sine it allows easy fullscreen without running as root).
</p>
<p>
And adding a 320x240 mode will most definatly get you a very nice fullscreen
 display at scale = 1 ;)
</p>
<p>
Don't forget that you need still need to set up the Modes line of the 
  &quot;Display&quot; subsection of the &quot;Screen&quot; section of your X
 config file if you want the games to fill the screen in DGA mode. Xmame will
 pick the best mode it can find, so if you have a line like:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    Modes  &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot; &quot;320x240&quot; &quot;256x224&quot;
</verb>
</p><p>
then any game which fits into a 320x240 screen can be displayed in that
 resolution, and so on. Don't forget you X11 config file might have a number
 of different &quot;Screen&quot; sections in it, and you will need to add Modes
 to the one that is actually active with your Xserver is running. And of course
 it's not always that easy, since you also need to tell X what monitor settings
 are required for these resolution modes. This is done through Modeline entries
 in the &quot;Monitor&quot; section of your X config file.
</p>
<p>
You can check out the <tt>/contrib/tools/modelines</tt> file for a set of crazy
 modes made especially for xmame in DGA mode, they should work on any reasonable
 multisync, but don't use them on an old fixed-frequency (well if you can't
 resist trying I won't pay for a new one)
</p>
<sect2>
SPEEDUP &num; 3 - NASM
<p>
You can also try installing nasm and compiling the asm core, that helps
 a bit too.
</p>
<sect1>
I've got a dual processor machine. What can I do to take full advantage
 of this?
<p>
Not much. Xmame is a single-threaded port of a single-threaded DOS app.
 Some degree of speedup will hopefully be found on an SMP since xmame is more
 likely to get to hog its one CPU for longer. But of course the same applies
 to any CPU-intensive program. And all the things one would normally do to any
 application to give it more CPU time (higher priority, kill or renice unecessary
 process, etc.) will work with xmame.
</p>
<p>
Now you may at this point be thinking &quot;Surely you could have one thread
 doing emulation and another thead doing graphics to get a speedup.&quot; Yes,
 but there are some serious issues to consider. The first is synchronisation
 between the threads, which needs to be pretty tight. If not done smoothly the
 overhead will blow most of the benefit away. Also it needs to be implemented
 with a portable threads interface ... which basically means POSIX threads.
 In a nutshell its a lot of effort and probably not much gain. But of course
 if you are feeling particulary energetic and in the mood to code then patches
 can always be submitted to the xmame devel mailing list ... :)

Why doesn't my joystick handle diagonal movement correctly on my Intel
 x86 system?
<p>
Xmame/xmess uses autocalibrating but you could try to use specific programs
 to calibrate it ( jscal that comes with joystick  module works fine.... )
</p>
<sect1>
How do I enable XinputExtensions X11 based joystick in Xfree86?
<p>
You need to edit XF86Config to enable the XInput section. See the  manual
 page for XF86Config.
</p>
<sect1>
How do I read a manual page?
<p>
Easy. If you want to read the manual page for XF86Config, type: man XF86Config

Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling? <label id="FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?" >
<p>
Xmame/xmess versions newer then 0.35 use zlib for some compression routines.
 Unfortunatly a lott of Linux distributions have an old version of zlib installed
 as /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a And the new version installed as /usr/lib/libz.a.
 If this is the case its harmless to remove /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a. If your not
 sure wether this is the case just move /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a to another location.
</p>
<p>
Removing or just moving /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a should fix this problem.
</p>
<p>

Xmame/xmess versions newer then 0.35 use zlib for some compression routines.
</p>
<p>
Zlib is standard on most Unix versions, for those who don't ship with zlib
 or ship with a too old version xmame/xmess now comes with a stripped down version
 of zlib. Uncomment the appropriate line in the Makefile to use this.
</p>

The xmame/xmess Home Page always has the most up to date version. The address
 is:

FX-Mame a glide driver for xmame
<p>
The latest version of this driver can be obtained at: <url url="http://glmame.linuxgames.com" name="http://glmame.linuxgames.com">
</p>
<sect2>
Requirements
<p>
To run FXmame you must have:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
A 3Dfx card
 <item>
Glide 2x o the xmame distribution
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Compiling and Installing
<p>
FXmame comes in two flavours -- xfx and svgafx. The xfx version is designed
 to run under X11. It uses an X window for input. The svgafx version runs from
 the console, and uses svgalib for input. Both use the 3Dfx hardware for rendering.
</p>
<p>
To install FXmame, follow the general instructions for installing xmame.
 To specify the glide driver, do the following the Makefile:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Select either &quot;xfx&quot; or &quot;svgafx&quot; as your display method
 <item>
Configure the glide variables to correspond to your glide setup
</itemize>
</p><p>
The FXmame executables are called &quot;xmame.xfx&quot; and &quot;xmame.svgafx&quot;
</p>
<sect2>
Running
<p>
FXmame runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard commands
 that xmame.x11 does.
</p>
<p>
A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the glide driver:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
RIGHTCTRL-A -- toggle antialiasing in vector games 
 <item>
RIGHTCTRL-B -- toggle bilinear filtering
</itemize>
</p><p>
The glide driver also adds several command-line options:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    -fxgama &lt;value&gt; 3Dfx gamma correction value
</verb>
</p><p>
Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display in vector
 games, I have to overlay the game bitmap over the vector display. This is because
 I circumvent the bitmap entirely in vector games. Drawing the bitmap is a big
 cpu hog, so you'll notice that the game slows down when you turn on the fps
 display (I know, not ideal when you want to find out the frame rate...)
</p>
<sect2>
Common Questions (FAQ)
<p>
Q: When I run FXmame, it just dumps core.
</p>
<p>
A: Make sure you are running FXmame as root. Root priviledges are required
 to access the 3Dfx hardware
</p>
<p>
Q: When I run xmame.xfx, it just hangs at the initial game screen
</p>
<p>
A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard input under
 KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers or use xmame.svgafx instead.
</p>
<sect2>
Present Limitations/Bugs
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
antialiasing isn't working quite as well as it should o input problems
 under KDE

GL-Mame a OPENGL driver for xmame
<p>
The latest version of this driver can be obtained at: <url url="http://glmame.linuxgames.com" name="http://glmame.linuxgames.com">
</p>
<sect2>
Requirements
<p>
To run GLmame you must have:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
An OpenGL implementation
 <item>
libjpeg
 <item>
hardware 3D acceleration (if you want any kind of framerate) o the xmame
 distribution
</itemize>
</p><sect2>
Compiling and Installing
<p>
Follow the general instructions for installing xmame. To specify the OpenGL
 driver, do the following in the Makefile:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
Select &quot;xgl&quot; as your display method
 <item>
Configure the OpenGL variables to correspond to your OpenGL implementation
 <item>
Configure the CABDIR variable
</itemize>
</p><p>
The GLmame executable is called &quot;xmame.xgl&quot;
</p>
<sect2>
Running
<p>
xmame.xgl runs with the same parameters and uses the same keyboard commands
 that xmame.x11 does.
</p>
<p>
The program starts up in cabinet mode. While this is pretty, and cool,
 you'll probably want to actually play in fullscreen mode.
</p>
<p>
A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the OpenGL driver:
</p>
<p>
<itemize>
 <item>
RIGHTCTRL-B -- toggle bilinear filtering
 <item>
RIGHTCTRL-C -- toggle cabinet/fullscreen display
 <item>
RIGHTCTRL-T -- toggle phosphor trails --use at your own risk! -- it works
 best if double buffering is disabled (see below)
</itemize>
</p><p>
The OpenGL driver also adds several command-line options:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    -&lsqb;no&rsqb;dblbuffer          Disable/enable double buffering
    -cabview                Start in cabinet view mode
    -nocabview              Start in fullscreen view mode
    -cabinet &lt;cabname&gt;      Use the cabinet model &lt;cabname&gt;
    -fxgama &lt;value&gt;         3Dfx gamma correction value
</verb>
</p><p>
Two cabinet models are provided. The default, &quot;glmame&quot;, is designed
 to look like a standard arcade cabinet. The other, &quot;trans&quot;, is a
 box with a transparent games screen that you can see through.
</p>
<p>
Note that in order to display the game options or the fps display in vector
 games, I have to overlay the game bitmap over the vector display. This is because
 I circumvent the bitmap entirely in vector games. Drawing the bitmap is a big
 cpu hog, so you'll notice that the game slows down when you turn on the fps
 display (I know, not ideal when you want to find out the frame rate...) This
 overlaying seems to have some glitches in cabinet mode. I don't know what causes
 them.
</p>
<p>
<bf>*** IMPORTANT! ***</bf>
</p>
<p>
If you have trouble with GLmame, or it is slow, read the &quot;Common Questions&quot;
 section. Most of the questions people email me are answered here.
</p>
<sect2>
Cabinet Models
<p>
Cabinet model information is stored in the &quot;cab&quot; subdirectory
 of the directory you specified with the ROMPATH variable in the Makefile. Path
 information specified in xmamerc or with the 'rompath' shell environment variable
 is currently not used. Each cabinet model has it's own subdirectory. GLmame
 will first try to load either the user-specified cabinet model (using the -cabinet
 command-line option), or a model corresponding to the current game name. Failing
 that, it will use the generic &quot;glmame&quot; model.
</p>
<p>
A cabinet model directory must contain a geometry file &lt;modelname&gt;.cab,
 and any .jpg files used for textures on the model. The format of the .cab file
 will be familiar if you have ever programmed using OpenGL -- it looks much
 like an OpenGL display list. The format is as follows:
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    cabv1.0
</verb>
</p><p>
This header must be the first 7 characters of the file.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    &num;&lt;text&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Comment lines begin with '&num;'
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    begin &lt;type&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Begins a geometry object, where type is one of (polygon, quads, quad_strip,
 screen). Each &quot;begin&quot; must be paired with an &quot;end&quot; statement.
 A &quot;polygon&quot; is specified using one vertex per, well... vertex. &quot;quads&quot;
 are four-sided polygons, each specified by four vertices in order around the
 polygon. A &quot;quad_strip&quot; is a series of four-sided polygons, each
 of which shares an edge with the polygons before and after it in the strip.
 A &quot;screen&quot; is a quad that defines the actual area in 3D space where
 the game will be displayed. only one of these should be defined. For more info,
 look at any description of OpenGL geometry.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    end
</verb>
</p><p>
Ends the geometry object begun with &quot;begin&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    color4 &lt;r&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Changes the current color to the corresponding rgb value (specified as
 floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    color4 &lt;r&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;a&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Changes the current color to the corresponding rgba value (specified as
 floating point numbers between 0 and 1).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    shading &lt;type&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Sets the shading type. available types are &quot;smooth&quot; (which blends
 colors from one vertex to the next) or &quot;flat&quot; (which doesn't).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    vertex &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Specifies a vertex for the current geometry object as a point in 3-space.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    numtex &lt;num&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Specifies the number of different textures to be loaded. This declaration
 must precede any &quot;loadtex&quot; call.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    loadtex &lt;num&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Loads texture number &lt;num&gt; from .jpg file &lt;filename&gt;. The .jpg
 file *must* be &lt;width&gt; by &lt;height&gt; pixels, and both &lt;width&gt;
 and &lt;height&gt; must be powers of two (and must conform to the hardware
 requirements of any 3D card you want the cabinet to work with -- 256x256 for
 3Dfx).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    texcoord &lt;xcoord&gt; &lt;ycoord&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Sets the texture coordinate of the next vertex. This specifies where in
 2D texture space the vertex lies.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    enable texture
</verb>
</p><p>
Enables texture mapping (using the currently-selected texture).
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    disable texture
</verb>
</p><p>
Turns off texture mapping.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    settex &lt;num&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Select texture &lt;num&gt; for doing texturing. The texture must previously
 have been loaded using &quot;loadtex&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    camerapan &lt;num&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Starts the camera pan definition that will be followed by &lt;num&gt; camera
 transistions. After the last transision definition, the pan sequence must be
 ended with an &quot;end&quot; statement.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    goto &lt;lx&gt; &lt;ly&gt; &lt;lz&gt; &lt;px&gt; &lt;py&gt; &lt;pz&gt; &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Relocates and reorients the camera. The arguments are the same as are used
 by the OpenGL command &quot;gluLookAt()&quot;. The camera is positioned at
 point &lt;lx,ly,lz&gt;, pointing along vector &lt;px,py,pz&gt;, with &quot;up&quot;
 normal (the direction that is &quot;up&quot; for the camera) &lt;nx,ny,nz&gt;.
</p>
<p>
<verb>
    moveto &lt;lx&gt; &lt;ly&gt; &lt;lz&gt; &lt;px&gt; &lt;py&gt; &lt;pz&gt; &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt; &lt;frames&gt;
</verb>
</p><p>
Moves the camera to a new location (specified as in &quot;goto&quot;).
 The transition occurs over &lt;frames&gt; frames.
</p>
<p>
All commands must be on separate lines. Use the (somewhat) commented glmame
 cabinet as an example to work from.

Common Questions (FAQ)
<p>
Q: I am only getting a few frames-per-second. This sucks! What gives?
</p>
<p>
A1: You're probably running Mesa in software mode. You should read the
 &quot;README.3Dfx&quot; file in the Mesa distro. Specifically, you need to
 &quot;setenv MESA_GLX_FX fullscreen&quot;
</p>
<p>
A2: You don't have a 3D graphics card. Go buy one!
</p>
<p>
Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just dumps core. That's not as much fun as
 3D Pacman, now is it?
</p>
<p>
A1: If you are using a 3Dfx card, make sure you are running xmame.xgl as
 root. Root priviledges are required to access the 3Dfx hardware
</p>
<p>
A2: If you're using Mesa and haven't upgraded to v3.0, do so.
</p>
<p>
Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just hangs at the initial game screen
</p>
<p>
A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get keyboard input under
 KDE. If you have this problem, switch window managers

The X-Mame mail list is intended to be a technical forum for XMame  developers

  <item>

  <item>
To share patches and notify bugs 
  <item>
Study new design strategies
  <item>
To expose problems and learn know-how
 </itemize>
 <item>
The X-Mame mail list <bf>is not</bf> a forum about playing games (but everyone in
 xmame-list plays...), so please:
 <itemize>
  <item>
<bf>Dont use the list to ask about ROM's</bf>
  <item>
<bf>Dont ask about non-UNIX ports of Mame, just about MAME and X-Mame</bf>
  <item>
<bf>Dont ask for implementing a game. Just search doc and contribute yourself
 (you'll enjoy twice: programming and playing...)</bf>
  <item>
<bf>Dont show your last high score in xxx game (we are interested in programming,
 and then playing, in this order)</bf>
 </itemize>
 <item>
<bf>Copyright notice: NEVER, I repeat NEVER send ROM images to the  list.</bf> (but
 you can tell where to retrieve it... ;-) )
 <item>
