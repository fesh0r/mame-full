0.71.1

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
(none)

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- [NES] Updated NES so that it uses the ppu2c03b support within MAME (which
  was actually originally based on the MESS NES driver code). [Brad Oliver,
  Nate Woods]
  
- [PC] Made fonts, monitor types and CGA chipsets configurable. [John Elliot] 

- [SNES] Name select is only for sprites using tiles over 255. Fixed sprite
  wrap at the bottom of the screen. Fixed clearing of HDMA channels. Fixed
  background colours in mode 0. [Jimmy Li, Anthony Kruize]

User Interface Changes:
-----------------------
- Added separate configuration menu, to be used for configuration items that
  were formerly represented with DIP switches.  [Nate Woods]
  
- [Windows] Revamped options menu, and added a keyboard customization menu.
  Also added the ability to create artwork for controller configuration
  screens (used NES as a testbed).  [Nate Woods]

Imgtool Changes:
----------------
(none)

Source Changes:
---------------
- Fixed a bug that would cause a hang when parsing certain invalid filenames
  (for example, D:\FOO\D:\FOO\BAR.ZIP). [Nate Woods]

- Revamped some inputs, added IPT_MOUSE, IPT_START, and IPT_SELECT.  The
  latter two can be used with IPF_PLAYER masks.  Also removed legacy
  IPT_SELECT1-4, and IPT_START1-4 should no longer be used by MESS.
