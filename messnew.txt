- [TI99, Geneve] Added hfdc HD support.  Changed floppy disk image format from
  the previous MESS-specific format to the more universal v9t9 format.  This
  does make any difference for single-sided images, but you will need to
  convert double-sided image. [Raphael Nabet]

  from track to track. [tim lindner]
