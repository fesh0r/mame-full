System Driver Changes:
----------------------

- [KC85/4 & KC85/3] Colours fixed. Added colour flash support. Improved accuracy of video redraw;
  mid frame changes are now supported (only flash changes are supported at this time); flashing
  lines in Boulderdash are reproduced now. Thankyou to Torsten Paul for his information about
  the colour flash. Swapped CLR and DEL keys (previously you had to press "delete" near Scroll
  Lock to delete back a char. Now you can press backspace).
  [Kev Thacker]

- [ORIC1/ORICA/TELSTRAT] Fixed .tap loading. (Conversion from .tap to internal .wav form was completely
  broken). [Kev Thacker]
  
- [COCO 3] More work on improving video timing for mid frame video register
  modification. [Nate Woods]

Other Changes:
--------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.37b12. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- [IMGTOOL] Added support for NC100/NC200 PCMCIA Ram Card images. Card can be formatted and files
  can be transfered to and from card filesystem. [Kev Thacker] 

- [machine/z80fmly] The Zero count/Timeout output pulse was very short. Now the pulse is
  active for longer. Required for KC85/4 colour flash to work! [Kev Thacker]

  this is used by the OS to seed the random number generator. Thanks to Kees van Oss for providing
  this information [Kev Thacker]

- [KC85/4] Implemented keyboard hardware. Previous hack has been removed.
  Seperated machine/kc.c into machine/kc.c and systems/kc.c.
  Merged all headers into includes/kc.h, and added all defines here.
  Cleaned up some of the code, and made sure allocated memory was free'd properly.
  Implemented preliminary tape reading using ".wav". Implemented preliminary
  sound emulation. Added IO_QUICKLOAD to load ".kcc" and binary files with 128 byte
  header. Load the file then type MENU and it should appear in the list, now you
  can type the name of the program to run it.
  [Kev Thacker]

- [ORIC1/ORICA/TELSTRAT] .tap tape images can now be used. These are converted
  at run-time into .wav files, and can be used in the same way as .wav. Code based
  heavily on tap2wav by Fabrice Frances [Kev Thacker, Fabrice Frances]


- [COCO 1/2/3] Reworked m6847 synchronization and sound mux signals to make
  them much more accurate.  Fixed a bug that caused the joystick to max out all
  the time. Added a new abstraction layer for cartridge IO interfaces.  Optimized
  graphics emulation a bit.  Adjusted default controls so that joystick buttons
  will work by default.  Improved PMODE 4 artifact colors to be more accurate
  (special thanks to John Kowalski for providing color information) [Nate Woods]

- [DRAGON] Fixed DragonDOS cartrdige, so now DragonDOS works fine.  [Nate Woods]

- [NC100/NC200] Fixed PCMCIA Memory card emulation: Read/Write state can be changed using
  a dipswitch in the UI, memory card changes are saved back to memory card file. 
  Discovered more about the NC200 hardware and updated the code. Cleaned up more
  of the source, added better description about the I/O ports and seperated it into 
  common code, nc100 only and nc200 only code. Serial baud rate was not setup correct,
  now fixed.
  [Kev Thacker]

Note: .inp record/playback does still not work currently.

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
- Chess Champion MK II [PeT]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------

- [ATOM] Finished floppy disc emulation. To use it you require a rom using
  the original 8271 memory locations (0x0a00-0x0a04). Linked in 6522via,
  more programs should work with it. Added printer support. 
  [Kev Thacker, Kees van Oss]

- [BBC] Added a new BBC clone (BBCB1770) to use the WD1770 disc controller.
  Much improved SAA5050 teletext support (mode 7), There is still a
  problem with the Mode 7 cursor.
  Added two new BBC clones they are BBCBP the BBC B Plus with 64K and
  the BBCBP128 the BBC B plus with 128K.
  Also Joystick support has now been added [Gordon Jefferyes]

- [AMSTRAD CPC] Added support for printer. [Kev Thacker]

- [GameBoy] Finally fixed the interrupt problem, which in turn helped a lot of carts 
  actually run now. [Lee Ward] 

- [Vectrex] Loading carts should work again. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- [ORIC] Rewrote to use 6522via code in MESS core. Previously it had it's own 
  implementation which was not complete. Added floppy disc emulation (emulates a 
  Microdisc interface). Added support for MFM_DISK disk image type as used by 
  Euphoric. This driver uses the IO_CASSETTE device, and can be controlled with 
  the "Tape Control" menu. However, this is not working yet.
  Previous method for loading tapes has been disabled. Floppy disc emulation
  does not appear to be working fully yet. [Kev Thacker]

- [COCO/DRAGON] Added support for printer.  Optimized graphics emulation. [Nate
  Woods]

- [Studio II] added cartridge support [PeT]

Other Changes:
--------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b8. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- pure DOS mode crash fixed [Ben Bruscella]

- SID6581 Approximation [PeT]
  Interface changed,
  partitioned, unused parts removed, cleaned up 
  support for multiple chips finished

- Imgtool now supports Virtual MSX Tape Archives (converts them to .cas files)
  and imgtool can convert .cas to .wav files. [Sean Young]

New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
- Amstrad NC200 (preliminary) [Kev Thacker]
- RCA Studio II [Peter Trauner]
- Sharp Pocket Computer PC1251 [Peter Trauner]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------

- [ATOM] Added preliminary floppy disc emulation. [Kev Thacker]

- [BBC B] Updated to use updated 8271 FDC code. Disk images can be used and games
  can be loaded and played. [Kev Thacker]
 
- [BBC B] Cleaned up the memory accessing a little. This fixed a problem with
  the DNFS rom thinking it found an econet controller. [Gordon Jefferyes]

- [SAM COUPE] Updated Sam Coupe to use WD179x code (same as WD1772). [Kev Thacker]

- [COCO] Updated CoCo and CoCo 3 drivers with new rom sets to match the actual chips 
  in the system.  coco.rom split into bas12.rom, extbas11.rom and disk11.rom, and 
  coco3.rom now must be of length 32768.  This requires a dump from an EPROM reader.  
  Fixed a bug in cassette writing.  Cassette tape controls and CoCo motor signal now 
  operate independently.  [Nate Woods]

- [C16] added SIDCARD support at address $d400 [Peter Trauner]

- [NES] new sound core. [Matt Conte]

Other Changes:
--------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b7. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- Fixed write protect reporting in WD179x [Kev Thacker]

- Added "Disk Control" menu to the user interface. With this you can
  enable/disable a drive (e.g. this is comparable to connecting a disconnecting
  a drive to the real machine), set write enable/write protect of the disc,
  and selecting between disc image and real drive access. Real drive access
  is currently limited to the drivers which use the WD179x, NEC765 and Intel
  8271 floppy disc controllers. [Kev Thacker]

- Removed hard-coded disk image format in the WD179x code. This floppy
  disc controller emulation uses the same disk image access as the NEC765 and
  Intel 8271. It can now support different disk image formats, and as before
  real discs in a real drive [Kev Thacker]

- NEC765 and Intel 8271 can now use real disc access in DOS version
  of MESS. Run under pure DOS, or in a Windows 95
  DOS box mode for this to work correct. [Kev Thacker]

- Imgtool now supports CoCo cassette files (both .CAS and .WAV).  This is done
  through a framework that makes it easy to implement cassette images in
  general.  Also, the CoCo RSDOS disk handling is now a bit more tolerant
  [Nate Woods]

- Updated Intel 8271 floppy disc controller emulation. [Kev Thacker]

- CRC and sysinfo updates will now be appearing at the official MESS homepage:

- COCO 3: Fixed low resolution video so that it is sensitive to the MMU; this
  fixes a problem that made OS-9 Level 2 display garbage.  Also fixed two bugs
  that prevented horizontal scrolling from working properly [Nate Woods]

Other Changes:
--------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b6. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- [DOS] File handling has CHANGED!  heres a brief description:
  MESS supports a softwarepath= global setting (in the [directories] section of mess.cfg) 
  and this is overrideable per driver (in the [driver] sections) Default for softwarepath= 
  is .;SOFTWARE
  OSD_FILETYPE_ROM uses the biospath= setting from now on (MAME rompath=) Default for 
  biospath= is .;BIOS.
  OSD_FILETYPE_IMAGE_R and _RW use the softwarepath= settings from now on, so BIOS ROMs can 
  be kept separate from carts, floppy, harddisk etc. images.
  The search paths/files are for a hypothetic system driver 'sys':
  
  extensions of carts for sys = .rom, .bin
  softwarepath = .;x:/software

  mess sys -cart cart

  ./cart
  ./sys/cart
  ./cart.zip containing cart
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart
  x:/software/cart
  x:/software/sys/cart
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart
  ---> assume it failed, because the real extension is .bin
  ./cart.rom
  ./sys/cart.rom
  ./cart.zip containing cart.rom
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  x:/software/cart.rom
  x:/software/sys/cart.rom
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart.rom
  ---> still not found, so image_fopen() tries .bin now
  ./cart.bin
  ./sys/cart.bin
  ./cart.zip containing cart.bin
  ./sys/cart.zip containing cart.bin
  x:/software/cart.bin
  x:/software/sys/cart.bin
  x:/software/cart.zip containing cart.bin
  x:/software/sys/cart.zip containing cart.bin

  As you can see it might take quite some time until an image is found, with two 
  directories on the path already, that's why the main softwarepath= setting should be 
  short. If you have many, different drives/paths where you store software, you better use 
  the system specific overrides like this:

  [sys]
  biospath=x:/sys
  softwarepath=x:/sys
  
  [sys2]
  biospath=roms
  sofwarepath=z:/somewhere/sys2
  
  However, if you have a 'complete set' you would be done (mostly) if you only change the 
  [directories] setting for biospath= and softwarepath= to the drive/path where your 
  mirrored files are.

  One extension to the searches that might make sense would be to also look into a 
  path/ext/cart.ext directory, that means you could have subirectories for eg. dsk, cas, 
  vz, bin or whatever the extensions of the system are. [Juergen Buchmueller, Ben Bruscella]

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- NES: Now features battery support and vastly improved PPU emulation - compare Kirby and 
  RC Pro Am. 
  * Palette is no longer hardcoded - it is mathematically generated. It may need some 
  formulaic tweaking, but it's pretty accurate.  
  * Games like GI Joe Atlantis Factor are working again, the NES Test cartridge no longer fails.  
  * There is a compile switch to emulate the color intensity used in Chris Covell's "Wall" demo. 
  It's off by default because it requires 16-bit mode and the sprite blitters need rewriting to 
  support 16-bit. Still, you can enable it to see the demo run as it was intended.  
  * Many mapper fixes: mapper 18 irqs should be close, mapper 19 added, the mid-20 Konami 
  mappers are nearly 100%, and some of the mappers in the 60's are much more accurate.  
  *Super Mario 3  _finally_ works! Excitebike also works again, and elite and PAL games, 
  Elite will draw properly -- but only using the PAL NES emulation.  
  * Fixed some more timing errors, Bayou Billy sine wave looks perfect now. 
  * low/high sprite priorities fixed. Super Mario 3 uses low priority sprites to mask out 
  pieces of high priority ones.
  * low-priority sprite/background transparency problem fixed (see Jaleco's Bases Loaded 3)
  * Mapper 5 is much better, although some interrupt problems remain.
  * Mappers 9/10 are _almost_ perfect.
  * Fixed mapper 16 - it was completely wrong.
  * Fixed rendering problems in mapper 68 (Afterburner 2).
  * Fixed mapper 69 (Batman: Return of the Joker).
  * Mapper 70 (arkanoid 2 j) works, but is it right? It starts up on round 0, which appears 
  to be the last round and not the first.
  * Implemented some Taito mappers (80, 82).
  * Implemented Konami VRC7, minus OPL (mapper 85).
  * Preliminary support for the zapper via a fake dipswitch. Collision detection isn't 
  working yet.
  * Modified sound core to read dpcm samples from the right place in memory. Added clock 
  specifier and read/write callbacks for register $14. NES driver now hooks into this for 
  sprite DMA. 
  * Zapper support, configurable via the fake dipswitches. Most games look for it connected 
  to the 2nd input port, not the first. Tested it with Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. If any 
  other zapper games don't work, let me know and I'll beat them down.
  * 4-player joypad support, also configurable via the fake dipswitches. For best results, 
  set both ports to the double setting. I tested it in Gauntlet 2 and RC Pro Am 2. Again, 
  let me know if it's busted in any other 4p games.
  * Fixed sprite priorities for the last time. I swear it's really working now. ;-) As a 
  side effect, the rendering code is a bit faster than before. 
  * More mapper fixes/additions.  
  * Added support for Famicom Disk System. Split up the main NES driver into NES and 
  Famicom. Only the Famicom supports the disk system, because that's the way it is in real 
  life. Press p1 button 3 to cycle amongst the disk sides. Once you switch a side, you may 
  need to wait a second or two for the switch to be recognized. Let me know if any games 
  fail to see the switch. Disk writing is not yet supported.
  * Added preliminary support for the Arkanoid paddle. It's pretty busted at the moment.
  * Fixed a small PPU bug regarding reads from the chr-gen ram portion of the ppu.
  * Correct display of left-most column when it has been programmatically disabled - 
  see SMB3.
  * Added some more mappers, some of which aren't working fully.
  * Fixed mapper 40 (SMB2j pirate) - it should be close to 100%
  * Fixed some issues with the disk support. It now supports that stupid padded format with 
  the useless header in addition to the other format.
  * DPCM samples fixed (now hear SMB3 in all it's steel drum glory).
  [Brad Oliver]

- COCO: Now using schedule_full_refresh() and PAK loader fixes applied [Nate Woods]

- KAYPRO: Keyboard fixed [Juergen Buchmueller]

- PCW16: emulation is fully working. To run this you need the "OS rescue disk". The system 
  rom is contained on the OS rescue disc and you will need this to install the OS. This 
  disc is available on the net, do a search to find it. [Kev Thacker]

- PC: improved PC-AT keyboard emulation to work with PCW16. Should work better with PC 
  emulation too.  Improved PC-Serial Mouse emulation to work with PCW16, improved PC FDC 
  emulation to work with PCW16. FDC now works as before but uses same nec765 code as the 
  Amstrad and Spectrum drivers. More software that programs the FDC directly should work.
  Changed PIO code in PC-XT to use 8255 emulation. Seperated PC-LPT code to be used with 
  PCW16. seperated and improved PC-Serial code. Works with PCW16 now, and interrupts are 
  set/cleared correctly. seperated pc floppy disc handling code for use with PCW16.
  Fixed tandy1000 problem, pc's changed to use pckeybrd, split pc_cga, pc_mda, pc_t1t from 
  pc and fixed atcga, xtvga init/blink problems.  changed uart8250 and pc_mouse interface, 
  realtime clock fixes and improvements (starts with current time) better vga retrace 
  emulation, fixed mouse problem in pc's (was a simple inputport configuration problem)
  [Kev Thacker, Peter Trauner]

- SPECTRUM: The border displaying code is now includes a full refresh flag. 128K port 
  decoding updated (still not exact on +3) - Sound now works on Zub 128K.
  [David Robertson]

- A7800: TIA sound update, which replaced the fixed/rand() polynome initializations to 
  ones based on the same algorithms that are used in the Pokey driver.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- TRS80: Split the ROMs into the 4K sizes they originally had 
  trs80.rom -> trs80.z33, trs80.z34 and trs80.zl2
  sys80.rom -> sys80rom.1 sys80rom.2 and sys80rom.3
  added an trs80alt driver for the 'R/S L2 BASIC' (its an original ROM with a shorter 
  bootstrap message and some code modifications). IO_CASSETTE now only loads *.cas files in 
  SYSTEM format and IO_QUICKLOAD is used for files in *.cmd format (disk excerpts)
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Commodore: m65ce02/m4510 timing corrected, fixed rtn, plp, rti, eom, added m65ce02 aug
  c65 speed improvements, ega/vga speed improvements [Peter Trauner]

- AMSTRAD: Changed video hardware code to use 6845 CRTC code.  Also added Eventlist code to 
  the Amstrad video hardware code. It will record colour changes, mode changes and crtc 
  register writes.  This means support for multi-modes on the same screen, colour changing 
  effects, and demos. There is a second method which updates between I/O writes that
  would affect the screen. The rendering method can be chosen with a compile switch.
  Also added correct opcode timings for Amstrad using new cpu_setcycletable, this
  means raster effects are now correct. Also added emulation of the Multiface hardware.
  It requires a rom (optionally loaded). You must enable it in the dipswitches. When
  enabled F1 will be the "stop" button. [Kev Thacker]

- ZX: Fixed ZX80 palette: it's black on white, and not viceversa. [Stefano Priore]

- CoCo/Dragon: Fixed a bug the CoCo 3 horizontal scroll so Crystal City is partially 
  playable now, converted the CoCo/Dragon driver to use an include file, moved PAK loading 
  code into a new src/mess/formats directory [Nate Woods]

- PDP/1: Fixed a null pointer access if no image is loaded. [Nate Woods]

- PC1401/1402/1350: Artwork support added [Peter Trauner]

- PCW: Added sound emulation. [Kev Thacker]

- PCW/CPC/SPECTRUM: Fixed some bugs in the disk image handling code used in
the Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, and Spectrum+3 drivers [Kev Thacker]


Other Changes:
--------------
- The core is based on MAME 0.37b5. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- NEC765: improved and more commands added, supports DMA access. Can handle
  images with copyprotection. A lot more software should now run on the 
  systems that use it (PCW,Spectrum, Amstrad,PC and PCW16). [Kev Thacker]

- 6522via Bug fix [Gordon Jefferyes]

- Optional ROM support. It can be used in MESS for BIOS ROMs for peripherals for which 
  you'd like to provide a valid crc32 without requiring the ROM. [Brad Oliver]

- Imgtool: Added a CRC command to imgtool so output image information in .crc format 
  basename()'s the command name when printing error info, Fixed a typo in the usage 
  examples, added a very rough imgtool.txt to document imgtool [Nate Woods]

- Added new endian macros [Nate Woods]

- DeviceIO bug fixed for most drivers [Juergen Buchmueller]

0.37b4

Note: .inp record/playback does still not work currently.


New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
Mac 512ke [Raphael Nabet]
BBC a&b (rename BBC) [Gordon Jefferyes, Kev Thacker]
Sharp Pocket Computer (prelim) [Peter Trauner]
Lisa2 [Raphael Nabet]
heaps of c65 variants [Peter Trauner]
XTVGA, ATCGA (prelim) [Peter Trauner]


System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- MACPLUS: Keyboard support added.  Variable memory configurations used now (a variable 
  named ram_size which can be initializzed to any value), and added variable ROM size, too.  
  Updated iwm.c to support Apple Diskcopy format : this will allow to exchange data with 
  real-world macintosh, and to use images from Mac sites.
  Fixed the RTC, and added a feature which initializes the Macintosh clock with the current 
  date and time.  Fixed some cosmetic sound core issues. [Raphael Nabet]

- SPECTRUM: Added support for .SCR (Screendump) files. Note that to ensure that the
  image is not immediately overwritten by the ROM initialisation routine the
  loading routine adds a short machine code press any key routine.  The Border engine 
  code now only uses those events with the correct ID
  instead of all events.  The specpls4 has been is now declared as GAME_COMPUTER_MODIFIED 
  .SCR files are now quickload files and are loaded by pressing F8.  The 128K machines are 
  now defined as GAME_NOT_WORKING because of the crashes when running 128K files.
  [David (aka Peter) Robertson]

- CoCo3: Now supports LPR field on INIT1 GIME register when in graphics modes, 
  fixed a bug that prevented video updates in hires 4-color modes. 
  Fixed high speed timer to have the correct speed.  Subtle tweaks to interrupt handling.  
  Special thanks to John Kowalski for info. [Nate Woods]

- CoCo/Dragon: Now supports memory size SAM register, removed 2nd fire button from 
  joysticks (only CoCo 3 has this). Video display now draws border. [Nate Woods]

- CoCo/CoCo3/Dragon: Optimized screen refresh routines accross the entire family.  
  Routing cassette audio to the speaker (AUDIO ON command in basic) now supported.  
  Documented more references about the CoCo hardware, as well as added docs for hardware 
  enhancements not supported yet. Interrupt timings now relative to clock cycles for more 
  exact timing.  Also, much more documentation. [Nate Woods]

- UK101/Superboard: Tidy up palette code, Caps lock implemented properly, Memory config. 
  4K, 8K and 40K. Added MC6850 ACIA. Cleaned up keyboard port_bits, Tape load.
  Hand crafted a superboard II graphics rom. Source YC July 82.  Swapped monitors roms, 
  wrong way around. Superboard video is 64 by 16 Max. UK101 video is 32 by 25 Max.
  To load tape images from Basic, type "LOAD", wait for the program to load, press space, 
  then RUN, LIST, etc. Some images should be loaded from the monitor, asteroids, 
  asteroids+ and scramble. When in the monitor, press L and wait for the program to load 
  and run. [Paul Daniels]

- NASCOM: Tidy up palette code. Nascom1 tape load. Memory config. 1Kb, 16Kb, 32Kb, 40Kb at 
  1000.  Test all known software. .cas done. .bin done. .nas done. Cleaned up keyboard 
  port_bits. [Paul Daniels]

- Apple1: Cleaned up code. Tidied up colour palette. Added memory configs. [Paul Daniels]

- Jupiter ace: Tidied up colour palette. Added memory configs. [Paul Daniels]

- BBC: The Hi-Res video modes have been improved with  full 6845 CRTC emulation, and 
  preliminary Teletext support has now been added. [Gordon Jefferyes]

- CBM: added c128 resolution switching, added c65 resolution switching, interlace support
  renamed c65 system to c65e, changed c64gs to pal. [Peter Trauner]

- PC: added vga resolution switching [Peter Trauner]



Other Changes:
--------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.37b4. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- TOOLS: Created an "osdtools.h" file that implements cross platform defininitions for 
  the tools (dat2html, imgtool, etc) [Nate Woods]
  added a info function (info is showed before the file listing in the dir command), added 
  extract command to allow conversion between file formats with create and extract 
  functions, added stream_clear to clear files (fopen(...,"w+")), added some parameters to 
  the create and put commands, c64crt c64 cartridge file support, more for professional 
  use (c64 cartridge dumper) and t64 c64 tape format support. [Peter Trauner]

- Implemented a new palette in tms9928a, computed from TI datasheet.  [Raphael Nabet]

- Cassette/wave code: Adds the ability to mute the cassette audio output.  This is done 
  by setting bit 1 of the device status.  [Nate Woods]

- SC61860 CPU core [Peter Trauner]

  in .Z80 blocks was not decoded - Head Over Heels now works. 
  .TAP files now classified as cassettes files not snapshots because of how they are 
  used - this now means they appear on Tape Control menu, corrected clock speed of 
  TS2068, fixed Issue 2/3 dipswitch implementation, dipswitch to enable/disable disk 
  drives on +3 and clones (disabling disk drives on +3 correctly shows machine as +2a 
  on start up menu). implemented TS2068/TC2048 64 column and hires modes, rewrote 
  Spectrum 128 screen refresh to use plot_pixel for a major speedup. 
  Fixed bug that created a new file if trying to use a non-existant .TAP file, modified 
  border size based on the comp.sys.sinclair FAQ (48 pixels at the left, right and top 
  and 56 pixels at the bottom of the screen, initial support for border colour - fills 
  entire border with last the outputted colour, border colour set when loading snapshots.
  Added a Border Engine to all Spectrum machines. [David Robertson]

- C65: added m4510 core, memory management changed and keyboard finished, DMA 
  controller enhanced, quickloader fixed, added floppy simulation for devices 10,11, 
  very early support of special c65/vic3 videomodes, (on the funet disks are only some 
  graphic demos, works when you change disk access (bload, loadiff) to:
  bload "name",u10
  loadiff "name",u10
  (load with dload"name",u10 or load"name",10)
  (and change the names to 8 letters in msdos.  [Peter Trauner]

- C16: emulated flashing mode of the TED chip, activated and fixed blinking. 
  Disabled blinking in multicolor modes (winter edition) [Peter Trauner]

- PC series: Changed osd_modify_pen calls to palette_change_color.  Emulation of the

  support (fixes disk support), added turboswitch functionality, changed frequency 
  to 8 MHz, removed some dipswitches.  [Peter Trauner]

- CoCo/Dragon/MC-10: Better .CAS file support, now supports cassette writes, 
  slightly better .PAK file support. [Nate Woods]

- CoCo: Now uses the standard wd179x code.  As a result, src/mess/machine/cocodisk.c 
  is not necessary anymore, implemented 63.5usec horizontal sync interrupt 
  (Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), implemented secondary fire buttons for both joysticks 
  (Dragon/CoCo/CoCo 3), keyboard interrupt (CoCo 3). [Nate Woods]

- CBM: cbm floppy drive simulation names for file system access changed, floppy disk 
  simulation for pet series (not working with first pet and superpet), added 8096 memory 
  expansion to cbm80 series, and cartridge/rom support in pet and cbmb series.

- Bug fix in the wave handler (when image is closed, osd_fclose() is now called 
  on the file descriptor [Nate Woods]

- Bug fix in the tape control that cause the control to give percentage erros when 
  using *.cas files. [Nate Woods]

- ImgTool: Preliminary PC Hard drive driver, better error reporting, a new command 
  ('good') that functions as a rom sorter (a la GoodNes).  CRC information is retrieved 
  from the standard MESS CRC files, the 'crc' command is replaced with 'info'.  This new 
  command will return data regarding the image if MESS's CRC files are aware of the 
  image. dir and del now can take multiple arguments. [Nate Woods]

  (Boulderdash), Tandy1000 Graphics memory switching enchanced (Lemmings), 
  Joystick changes (slow autocenter remaining), added xtcga with mf2 keyboard 
  and turbo switch, split the xtvga in xtega (vga with ega monitor), and added 
  palette handling to ega/vga. [Peter Trauner]

- C364: preliminary speech added (similar hardware in the C64 
  cartridge Magic Voice, used in few programs). [Peter Trauner]

- C128: Esc-x to switch c128 to 40 column mode. Keypad enter to switch 
  emulator to 40 column mode. In the input keys configuration menu you 
  should find several key assignments with normal (not reversed)T.  Change 
  these to another key, and the normal T will work. (in the system file 
  these keys are disabled, until I find a better solution) [Peter Trauner]

- MACPLUS: driver boots (must use the 68k C core) [Nate Woods]

- SEGA MASTER SYSTEM: Rewrite of the SMS video code, so quite a lot of games with
  interrupt problems or corrupt graphics run fine now. [Charles MacDonald]

- SPECTRUM: Added support for 128K .SNA and .Z80 files, ensured that the 48K Basic 
  ROM is paged in when running 48K snapshots on 128K machine (for improved 
  reliability and access to the default character set), changed +3 initialisation, 
  128 and +3 now set 0x4000-0x7fff to bank 5 (Now not changed if switching to shadow 
  screen), cleaned up spectrum_plus3_update_memory, fixed bug in decoding uncompressed 
  v2+ .Z80 files, and changed running speed of 128K Machines to 3.54690MHz

  50 hertz machines now really have 50 hz video refresh, c16 1551 simulation fixed 
  [Peter Trauner]

- DRAGON series: Now supports a new variant of the .PAK file format for snapshots.
  [Nate Woods]

- TI99:  Mini Memory Support (rename minimemc.bin to minimemm.bin for it to 
  work correctly), fixed a bug in banked roms when a hard reset (F3) is done, rom 
  images are now identified by their filename extensions (image order isn't important 
  anymore), no need to use NUL when no grom image, both alt -> fctn and both ctrl -> ctrl 
  added, and new rom image extensions (.c .d .m .g .crom. drom. mrom .grom).
  [Norberto Alfredo Bensa]

- A7800: Support for bankswitched carts and carts with extra RAM, added 160B video mode, 
  increased screen height to fix clipping at bottom, updated header format (details can be 
  found in machine/a7800.c), added support for light gun trigger (not the light gun 
  targetting yet, just the trigger), and removed requirment for a cartridge (since the 7800 
  starts in the BIOS it doesn't technically need a cartridge) [Dan Boris]




Other Changes:
--------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.37b2. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- TOOLS: Disk Utility added (mkhdimg.exe) which will create variable sized HD images 
  for use in MESS.  Can create images from 9,216 bytes to 142,606,848 bytes 
  without problems.  The Western Digital 1004A that is emulated in MESS is 
  limited to 1024 Cylinders and 16 heads. The sector size is limited to 512 
  bytes as well as the sectors per track being limited to 17, this is also 
  due to the WD1004A's limitations. [Randy Rains]

- TOOLS: Generic image tool added (imgtool.exe) with the following features:
  *MAME/MESS style driver architecture; where the image formats are contained in drivers.  
   Currently, the only driver is for CoCo .DSK disk images, but there could be more.
  *Runs on the command line.
  *Commands for listing image contents, retrieving and storing files.
  *Supports images in .ZIP files.
  *"Engine" is separate from the "shell"; which gives the potential for front ends for 
   those who don't like command lines. [Nate Woods]

- Disk write support for AMSTRAD CPC [Oscar Martín González]

- Wave timer fix [Oscar Martín González]

- m6510t/m7501/m8502 CPU cores added [Peter Trauner]

- Extensive CRC updates.
